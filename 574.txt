Our Heav’nly Father, We Come Nigh -8.7.8.7.D.

1.
Our heav’nly Father, we come nigh
We Thy children weak and faint
Fill us with Thy Holy Spirit
Grant that we be all renewed;
Come, Thou Holy Spirit do, come
Speak through us in a new tongue!
For Thy great gift we are pleading
Thy great gift of Pentecost.

2.
Lord, remember Thou Thy promise
Pour Thy Spirit on all flesh,
Give us of Thy peace, we pray Thee
Peace, the world cannot afford,
Come Thou Holy Spirit, do come
Sin destroy Thou in our hearts
For Thy great gift we are pleading
Thy great gift of Pentecost.

3.
Heav’nly Dove, descend upon us
Fill us with Thy power divine,
That the nations all may worship
To our Saviour yielded be,
Let us hear of Thy great power through
This dark continent of ours
For Thy great gift we are pleading
Thy great gift of Pentecost.
