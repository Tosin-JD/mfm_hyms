The Great Reaping Day

1.
There is coming a day when to lodgement we’ll go,
There to reap as in life we've sown.
Death eternal we’ll reap if we sow to the flesh,
Heaven's joys then will never be known.

CHORUS
May we sow righteous seed for the reaping
Which is coming to ev’ry one.
O the joy on that day when we hear Jesus say,
Come, ye blessed, a crown you have won.

2.
Ev’ry day passing by are sowing the seed
Fruits of life or of death will bear,
When you reap what you sow to that land may you go,
To that bright, happy home ever there.

3.
If you’d win life eternal there’s no: time to lose,
Look around you, the fields are white,
Go ye forth to the field, sow and reap golden grain,
Soon will fall the dark shadows of night.

4.
Ev’ry act you perform is as seed to some one,
For the influence will ne’er die,
Then be careful each day what you do, what you say,
For you’ll meet it again by and by.

- R. E. Winsett
