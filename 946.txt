Sound the Battle Cry

1.
Sound the battle cry I See! the foe is nigh;
Raise the standard high For the Lord;
Gird your armour on, Stand firm, ev’ry one;
Rest your cause upon His holy word.

CHORUS
Rouse, then, soldiers! rally round the banner!
Ready, steady, pass the word along;
Onward, forward, shout aloudHosannah!
Christ is Captain of the mighty throng.

2.
Strong to meet the foe, Marching on we go.
While our cause we know Must prevail;
Shield and banner bright Gleaming in the light;
Battling for the right, We ne’er can fail.

3.
Oh! Thou God of all, Hear us when we call;
Help us one and all, By Thy grace;
When the battle’s done, And the vict’ry won.
May we wear the crown Before Thy face.
