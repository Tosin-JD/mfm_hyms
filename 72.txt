My Redeemer - 8.7.8.7. with Refrain

1.
I will sing of my Redeemer
And His wondrous love to me;
On the cruel cross He suffered,
From the curse to set me free
CHORUS
Sing, O sing of my Redeemer,
With His blood He purchased me;
On the cross He sealed my pardon,
Paid the debt and made me free.

2.
I will tell the wondrous story,
How, my lost estate to save,
In His boundless love and mercy,
he the ransom freely gave.

3.
I will praise my dear Redeemer,
His triumphant pow’r I’ll tell,
How the victory He giveth
Over sin and death and hell.

4.
I will sing of my Redeemer
And His heav'nly love to me;
He from death to life hath bro’t me.
Son of God with Him to be.

- Philip P. Bliss
