Gathering after tears

1.
Steer our bark away to the Home land,
Spread the sails of hope o’er the sea;
Think of all the friends that awaits us,
When anchor’d safely there we shall be.

CHORUS
Gathering after tears into sunshine,
Gathering after labour into rest.
Hear the ransome'd throng shouting forth their joyful song,
Gathering to the mansions of the blest.

2.
Steer our bark away to the Homeland.
On without a fear let us go;
When the port of peace we are nearing,
The blessed harbour lights we shall know.

3.
Bright and fair the hills of he Homeland,
Clad in all the bloom of the spring:
There to Him who loved and redeemed us,
Our joyful, joyful praise we will sing

4.
Soft the winds that blow from the Homeland,
Sweet the morn that breaks on the shore
Seen we II meet again our beloved ones,
Where sorrow, pain, and death come no more.
