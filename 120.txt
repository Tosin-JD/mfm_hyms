Hursley-L. M.

1.
Sun of my soul, Thou Saviour dear,
It is not night if Thou be near;
O may no earth-born cloud arise
To hide Thee from Thy servant’s eyes!

2.
When the soft dews of kindly sleep
My weary eyelids gently steep,
Be my last thought, how sweet to rest
Forever on my Saviour's breast!

3.
Abide with me from morn till eve,
For without Thee I cannot live;
Abide with me when night is nigh,
For without Thee I dare not die.

4.
Be near to bless me when I wake.
Ere thru the world my way I take;
Abide with me till in Thy love
I lose myself in heav’n above.

- John Keble
