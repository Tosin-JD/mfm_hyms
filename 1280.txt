Serve the Lord in Youth

1.
Serve the Lord in the days of youth,
Learn His law and accept His truth;
Sing His praise with a ready tongue,
While the heart is young,
While yet the heart is young.

CHORUS
Serve the Lord in youthful days,
Do His will and walk His ways.
Wait not for what the years may
bring,But serve Him, O serve Him;

2.
Give to Him what He gave to you,
Buoyant strength and a courage true;
Ringing voices and eyes alight,
Souls all pure and white,
Unstained and pure and white.

3.
Serve Him then, ev'ry youthful day,
Choose His guidance without delay;
Waste no part of these precious years.
Youth soon disappears.
Too soon it disappear.
