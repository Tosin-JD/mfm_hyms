Getting Ready to Leave This World

1.
Laying up my treasures in that home above,
Trusting, fully trusting in the Savior's love;
Doing what I can for heaven's Holy Dove,
I’m a gettin’ ready to leave this world.

CHORUS
Gettin' ready to leave this world,
Gettin’ ready for the gates of pearl;
Keeping, watching, both
Gettin' ready to leave this world.

2.
Trusting in the riches of His saving grace,
In each earthly trial I His love can trace;
Sure that up in heaven I shall find a place,
I’m a gettin’ ready to leave this world.

3.
To prepare a mansion, Jesus said, Til go.
 If it were not true I would have told you so;”
Just a little while to linger here below,
I’m a gettin’ ready to leave this world
