All for Jesus – 8.7.8.7.

1.
I believe in God the Father
who created heaven and earth;
holding all things in his power,
bringing light and life to birth.

2.
I believe in God the Saviour,
Son of Man and Lord most high,
crucified to be redeemer,
raised to life that death may die.

3.
I believe in God the Spirit,
wind of heaven and flame of fire,
pledge of all that we inherit,
sent to comfort and inspire.

4.
Honour, glory, might and merit
be to God, and God alone!
Father, Son and Holy Spirit,
One-in-Three.
