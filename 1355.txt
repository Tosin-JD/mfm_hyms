Brighten the Corner Where You Are

1.
Do not wait until some deed of greatness you may do,
Do not wail to shed your light afar;
To the many duties ever near you now be true,
Brighten the corner where you are.

CHORUS
Brighten the corner where you are!
Brighten the corner where you are!
Someone far from harbor you may guide across the bar,
Brighten the corner where you are.

2.
Just above are clouded skies that you may help to clear,
Let not narrow self your waydebar;
Tho into one heart alone may fall your song of cheer,
Brighten the corner where you are.

3.
Here for all your talent you will surely find a need,
Here reflect the Bright and Morning Star;
Even from your humble hand the bread of life may feed,
Brighten the corner where you are.

- Ina Duley Ogdon
