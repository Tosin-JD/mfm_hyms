Maryton - L.M.

1.
O Master, let me walk with Thee
In lowly paths of service free;
Tell me Thy secret; help me bear
The strain of toil, the fret of care.

2.
Help me to slow the heart to move
By some clear, winning word of love;
Teach me the way-ward feet to stay,
And guide them in the home-ward way.

3.
Teach me Thy patience! Still with Thee
In closer, dearer company,
In work that keeps faith sweet and strong,
In trust that triumphs over wrong;

4.
In hope that sends a shining ray
Far down the futureâ€™s broadening way,
In peace that only Thou canst give,
With Thee, O Master, let me live.
