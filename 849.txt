Hyfrydol - 8.7.8.7.D.

1.
From the depths of sin and failure,
From the despair as black as night,
Lord, we hear our brothers calling
For deliverance and for light.

CHORUS
Use us, Lord, to speed Thy Kingdom;
Through us may Thy will be done:
Give us eyes to see the vision
Of a world redeemed and won.

2.
By the love that bore in silence
Man’s contempt and Satan’s dart;
By the longing for the lost ones
That consumes the Saviour’s heart;

3.
By the Saviour's blood that bought us,
By the peace His merits bring,
By the Spirit that constrains us
Now on earth to crown Him King;

- Timothy Rees
