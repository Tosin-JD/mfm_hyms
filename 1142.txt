Wait, and Murmur Not – L. M.

1.
O weary heart, there is a Home,
Beyond the reach of toil and care;
A Home where changes never come:
Who would not fain be resting there?

CHORUS
Oh wait, meekly wait, and murmur not!
Oh wait, meekly wait, and murmur not!
Oh wait. Oh wait Oh wait, and murmur not!

2.
Yet when bow'd down beneath the load
By heav’n allow’d, thine earthly lot;
Look up! thou it reach that blest abode:
Wait, meekly wait, and murmur not!

3.
If in thy path some thorns are found.
Oh, think who bore them on His brow;
If grief thy sorrowing heart has found,
It reached a holier than thou.

4.
Toil on! nor deem, though sore it be,
One sigh unheard, one prayer forgot;
The day rest will dawn for thee:
Wait, meekly wait, and murmur not!
