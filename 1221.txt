1.

Great God, we praise the mighty love,
which urges us to rise above
constricting doubts and fears;
whose purpose is to set us free
to live our lives creatively
throughout the coming years.

2.
We praise you for the love we see
in man and wife and family,
in friends and neighbours too;
the love which nurtured us from birth,
the love which teaches human worth
and leads our minds to you.

3.
We praise you most for love supreme
which breaks through pain and death
to stream in unrestricted light;
which from Christ's resurrection dawn
has shone, and never been with drawn,
to make our future bright.

4.
For by your perfect love refined
our own will not be undermined
by futile guilt and shame;
but through disaster, grief or strife
by futile guilt and shame;
but through disaster, grief or strife
weâ€™ll re-affirm the joy of life and glorify your name.
