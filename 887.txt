887
No One Ever Cared for Me Like Jesus

1.
I would love to tell you what I think of Jesus
Since I found in Him a friend so strong and true,
I would tell you how he changed my life completely
He did something that no other friend could do.

CHORUS
No one ever cared for me like Jesus,
There’s no other friend so kind as He;
No one else could take the sin and darkness from me,
O how much He cared for me.

2.
All my life was full of sin when Jesus found me,
All my heart was full of misery and woe;
Jesus plac’d His strong and loving arms about me,
And He led me in the way I ought to go

3.
Ev'ry day He comes to me with new assurance,
More and more I understand His words of love;
But I’ll never know just why He came to save me,
Till some day I see His blessed face above.
