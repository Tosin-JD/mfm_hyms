Venice - S.M.

1.
Lord God the Holy Ghost,
In this accepted hour,
As on the day of Pentecost,
Descend in all thy power

2.
The young, the old, inspire
With wisdom from above;
And give us hearts and tongues of fire.
To pray and praise and love.

3.
Spirit of truth, be thou
In life and death our guide;
O Spirit of adoption, now
May we be sanctified.

- J. Montgomery
