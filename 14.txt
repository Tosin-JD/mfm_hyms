Harts - 7.7.7.7.

1.
Brethren, let us join to bless
Christ, the Lord our righteousness;
Let our praise to Him be given.
High at God's right hand in heaven.

2.
Son of God, to Thee we bow;
Thou art Lord, and only Thou;
Thou the blessed virginâ€™s seed,
Glory of Thy church, and head.

3.
Thee the angels ceaseless sing;
Thee we praise, our Priest and King;
Worthy is Thy name of praise,
Full of glory, full of grace.

4.
Thou hast the glad tidings brought
Of salvation by Thee wrought;
Wrought to set Thy people free,
Wrought to bring our souls to Thee.

5.
May we follow and adore
Thee, our Saviour, more and more:
Guide and bless us with Thy love,
Till we join Thy saints above.
