Saffron Walden - 8.8.8.6.

1.
Oft when I seem to tread alone
Some barren waste with thorns o'er grown,
A Voice of love in gentlest tone
Whispers, "Still cling to Me."

2.
Though faith and hope a while to tried,
I ask not, need not, aught beside;
How safe, how calm, how satisfied,
The souls that cling to Thee!

3.
They fear not life's rough storms to brave,
Since Thou art near and strong to save;
Nor shudder e’en at death’s dark wave,
Because they cling to Thee.

4.
Blest is my lot, whate'er befall:
What can disturb me, who appal,
While, as my strength, my rock, my all,
Saviour, I cling to Thee?

- A. H. Brown
