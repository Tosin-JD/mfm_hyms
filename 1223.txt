Melcombe - L.M.

1.
O Father, Thou who givest all
The bounty of Thy perfect love,
We thank Thee that upon us fall
Such tender blessings from above.

2.
We thank Thee for the grace of home,
For mother’s love and father’s care;
For friends and teachers, all who come
Our joys and hopes and fears to share;

3.
For eyes to see and ears to hear,
For hands to serve and arms to lift,
for shoulders broad and strong to bear,
For feet to run on errands swift.

4.
For faith to conquer doubt and fear,
For love to answer every call.
For strength to do and will to dare,
We thank Thee, O Thou Lord of all.

- John Haynes Holmes
