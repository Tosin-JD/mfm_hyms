St. George's, Windsor - 7.7.7.7.D.

1.
Hark! the song of jubilee,
Loud as mighty thunders roar,
Or the fulness of the sea
When it breaks upon the shore:
"Hallelujah! for the Lord
God omnipotent shall reign:
Hallelujah!" let the word
Echo round the earth and man.

2.
"Hallelujah!" Hark! the sound
From the depths unto the skies,
Wakes above, beneath, around,
All creation's harmonies;
See Jehovah's banner furled,
Sheathed His sword; He speaks 'tis done,
And the kingdoms of this world
Are the kingdom of His Son.

3.
He shall reign from pole to pole
With illimitable sway;
He shall reign when like a scroll
Yonder heavens have passed away:
Then the end; beneath His rod
Man's last enemy shall fall;
"Hallelujah!" Christ in God,
God in Christ is All in all!

- Sir G. J. Elvey
