Brightly gleams our Banner

1.
Brightly gleams our banner, pointing to the sky,
Waving on Christ’s soldiers to their home on high!
Marching through the desert gladly thus we pray,
Still with hearts united, singing on our way.

CHORUS
Brightly gleams our banner, pointing to the sky
Waving on Christ’s soldiers to their home on high.

2.
Jesus, Lord and Master, at Thy sacred feet,
Here with hearts rejoicing, see Thy children meet,
Often have we left Thee, often gone astray;
Keep us mighty Saviour in the narrow way.

3.
All our days direct us in the way we go,
Lead us on victorious over every foe,
Bid Thine angels shield us when the storm clouds
Pardon Lord, and save us in the last dread hour.

4.
Then with saints and angels may we join above,
Offering prayers and praises at Thy throne of love,
When the march is over, then comes rest and peace
Jesus in His beauty, songs they never cease.

- Thomas J. Potter (1860)
