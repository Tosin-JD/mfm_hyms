1427
Saved By Grace

1.
Someday the silver cord will break,
And I no more as now shall sing;
But O the joy when I shall wake
Within the palace of the King!

CHORUS
And I shall see Him face to face,
And tell the story Saved by grace;
And I shall see Him face to face,
And tell the story Saved by grace.

2.
Some day my earthly house will fall,
I cannot tell how soon ‘twill be,
But this I know my All in All
Has now a place in Heav’n for me.

3.
Some day, when fades the golden sun
Beneath the rosy tinted west,
My blessed Lord will say, “Well done!”
And I shall enter into rest.

4.
Some day: till then I’ll watch and wait,
My lamp all trimmed and burning bright,
That when my Saviour opens the gate,
My souls to Him may take its flight.

- Fanny J. Crosby
