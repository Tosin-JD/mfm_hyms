Oh, be careful, little eyes, what you see,
Oh, be careful, little eyes, what you see,
For the Father up above Is looking down in love,
So be careful, little eyes, what you see.

2.
Oh, be careful, little ears, what you hear.
Oh, be careful, little ears, what you hear,
For the Father up above Is looking down in love,
So be careful, little ears, what you hear.

3.
Oh, be careful, little tongue, what you say.
Oh, be careful, little tongue, what you say.
For the Father up above is looking down in love,
So be careful, little tongue, what you say.

4.
Oh, be careful, little hands, what you do.
Oh, be careful, little hands, what you do,
For the Father up above is looking down in love,
So be careful, little hands, whatyou do.

5.
Oh, be careful, little feet, where you go,
Oh, be careful, little feet, where you go,
For the Father up above is looking down in love.
So be careful, little feet, where you go.
