Wonderful is my Redeemer

1.
Wonderful is my Redeemer,
wonderful is He,
Saving me from sin and sorrow,
washed at Calvary;
Wonderful the Prince of glory,
mighty God is He,
Wonderful is my Redeemer,
wonderful to me.

CHORUS
Wonderful, wonderful,
Jesus is to me, Gave Himself for my shame there at
Calvary; marvellous saving grace set my spirit free.
Wonderful is He.

2.
He gave Him self to die a ransom
there on yonder tree.
His saving grace my soul to save,
Could it ever be?
Salvation’s plan for ev’ry man He
purchased pardon free,
Wonderful is my Redeemer,
wonderful to me.

3.
Redeeming love sent from above,
He died for you and me,
Go tell the message of His love
Salvation now is free;
No longer wait, the fields are white the call o’er distant sea,
Wonderful is my Redeemer,
wonderful to me.
