Ellers-10.10.10.10.

1.
Search me, O God, and know my heart today;
Try me. O Saviour, know my thoughts, I pray.
See if there be some wicked way in me;
Cleanse me from evâ€™ry sin and set me free.

2.
I praise Thee, Lord, for cleansing me from sin;
Fulfil Thy Word and make me pure within.
Fill me with fire where once I burned with shame;
Grant my desire to magnify Thy name.

3.
Lord, take my life and make it wholly Thine;
Fill my poor heart with Thy great love divine.
Take all my will, my passion, self, and pride;
I now surrender; Lord, in me abide.

4.
0 Holy Ghost, revival comes fromThee;
Send a revival, start the work in me.
Thy word declares Thou wilt supply our need;
For blessings now, O Lord, I humbly plead.
