Conquerors through the blood

1.
Conquerors and overcomers now are we.
Thro’ the precious blood of Christ we've victory.
If the Lord be for us, we can never fail:
Nothing ‘gainst his mighty pow’r can e’er prevail

CHORUS
Conquerors are we
thro’ the blood, thro’ the blood;
God will give us victory
thro’ the blood, thro the blood.
Thro’ the Lamb for sinners slain.
Yet who lives and reigns again,
More than conquerors are we
More than conquerors are we.

2.
In the name of Israel’s God we’ll onward press,
Overcoming sin and all unrighteousness:
Not to us, but unto him the praise shall be
For salvation and for blood bought victory.

3.
Unto him that over cometh shall be giv’n
Here to eat of hidden manna sent from heav’n
Over yonder he the victor s psalm shall bear
And a robe of white, and golden crown shall wear.
