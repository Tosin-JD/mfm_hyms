The Song of the Soldier

1.
Rise, ye children of salvation.
All who cleave to Christ the Head;
Wake, arise! O mighty nation,
Ere the foe on Zion tread.

CHORUS
Pour it forth a mighty anthem,
Like the thunders of the sea;
Thro’ the blood of Christ our ransom,
More than conquerors are we.
More than conquerors are we,
More than conquerors we are;
Thro’ the blood of Christ our ransom,
More than conquerors are we.

2.
Saints and heroes long before us
Firmly on this ground have stood;
See their banners waving o’er us,
Conquerors through Jesus’ blood.

3.
Deathless, we are all unfearing,
Life laid up with Christ in God;
In the morn of His appearing
Fooweth forth a glory flood.

4.
Soon we shall all stand before Him,
See and know our glorious Lord;
Soon in joy and light adore Him.
Each receiving his reward.
