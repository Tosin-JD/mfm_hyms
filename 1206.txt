Before Thy Mercy Seat O Lord

1.
Before Thy mercy seat O Lord
Saviour before Thee we gather
To penitently beg for forgiveness
For all the covenants broken.

2.
We humbly renew our pledge
By Thy great strength do uphold us
To train our children religiously
To serve and do your perfect will.

3.
Grant us Thy grace to seek always
Salvation for acquiantances 
Trying to be; faithful in deportment
Walk circumspectly in the world.

4.
Grant us to faithfully keep pledge
And to be just in all dealings
Set worthy sample of Christian
In all we say and think and do.

5.

Help us to shun and to avoid
All forms of tattling, backbiting
Execessive anger to abhor
But quickly seek to reconcile.

6.

Grant us to watch over ourselves
In brotherly love affection
Cultivate Christian sympathy
Give aid in sickness and distress.

7.

We humbly plead Saviour Divine
Make us perfect in all good works
To do that which will please your will
As the saints in heaven comply.
