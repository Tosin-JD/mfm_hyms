The Power that fell at Pentecost

1.
The pow’r that fell at Pentecost,
When in the upper room,
Upon the watching, waiting ones.
The Holy Ghost had come,
Remaineth evermore the same;
Unchanging still, O praise His name.

CHORUS
The pow’r, the pow’r, the Pentecostal pow'r
Is just the same today, Is just the same today,
The pow’r, the pow’r, The Pentecostal pow’r,
Is just the same today.

2.
“Ye shall have power (said Jesus) when
The Holy Ghost is come;”
Your loosened tongues shall speak
His praise,Your lips no more be dumb;
The timid, shrinking ones be brave,
To reach a hand the lost to save.
3 The wav’ring shall steadfast become,
The weak in faith be strong,
With holy boldness going forth,
Denouncing sin and wrong;
With burning zeal each heart aflame,
A whole salvation to proclaim.

4.
Breathe on us now the Holy Ghost,
The young and old inspire;
Let each receive his Pentecost,
Set hearts and tongues a fire!
Thou wonderful transforming power,
Come now in this accepted hour.

- Mrs. C. H. Morris
