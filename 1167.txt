Each step I take

1.
Each step I take my Saviour goes before me,
And with His loving hand He leads the way.
And with each breath I whisper "I adore Thee;”
Oh, what joy to walk with Him each day.

CHORUS
Each step I take I know that He will guide me;
To higher ground He ever leads me on.
Until some day the last step will be taken,
Each step I take just leads me closer home.

2.
At times I feel my faith begin towaver.
When up ahead I see a chasm wide,
It’s then I turn and look up to my Saviour,
I am strong when He is by my side.

3.
I trust in God, no matter come what may,
For life eternal is in His hand,
He holds the key that opens up the way,
That will lead me to the promised land.
