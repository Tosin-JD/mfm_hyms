All saints-8.7.8.7.D.

1.
God hath spoken by His prophets.
Spoken His unchanging word.
Each from age to age proclaiming
God the One, the righteous Lord:
Mind the world's despair and turmoil
One firm anchor holden fast,
God is King, His throne eternal,
God the first and God the last.

2.
God hath spoken by Christ Jesus,
Christ, the everlasting Son,
Brightness of the Father’s glory,
With the Father ever one;
Spoken by the Word Incarnate,
God of God, ere time began,
Light of Light, to earth descending,
Man, revealing God to man.

3.
God yet speaketh by his Spirit
Speaketh to the hearts of men.
In the age-long word expounding
God’s own message, now as then;
Through the rise and fall of nations
One sure faith yet standing fast.
God abides, His word unchanging,
God the first and God the last.
