O Lord, Send the Power

1.
When the pow’r of God descended
On the day of Pentecost
All the days of waiting ended
They received the Holy Ghost.

CHORUS
O Lord, send the pow’r just now;
O Lord, send the pow’r just now;
O Lord, send the pow’r just now;
And baptise ev’ry one.

2.
Tongues of flame came down upon them,
And they preach’d the word with pow’r,
List'ning multitudes awakened
Turn’d to God that very hour.

3.
We are waiting Holy Spirit
We are all of one accord
Lord fulfil just now the promise
That is given in thy word

4.
Fill and thrill us with thy presence,
Grant the blessing that we need
Flood our souls with wondrous glory,
While the pray’r of faith we plead.
