1.
Hark, ‘tis the watchman’s cry:
Wake, brethren, wake!
Jesus Himself is nigh;
Wake, brethren, wake!
Sleep is for sons of night;
Ye are children of the light;
Yours is the glory bright;
Wake, brethren, wake!

2.
Call to each wakening bank:
Watch, brethren, watch!
Clear is our Lord’s command:
Watch, brethren, watch!
Be ye as men that wait
Always at their Master’s gate,
E’en though He tarry late;
Watch, brethren, watch!

3.
Heed we the Master’s call:
Work, brethren, work!
There’s room enough for all,
Work, brethren, work!
This vineyard of the Lord
Constant labour will afford;
He will your work reward:
Work, brethren, work!

4.
Hear we the Saviour's voice:
Pray, brethren, pray!
Would ye His heart rejoice,
Pray, brethren, pray!
Sin calls for ceaseless fear,
Weakness needs the Strong One
near:Long as ye struggle here.
Pray, brethren, pray!

5.
Sound how the final chord,
Praise, brethren, praise!
Thrice holy is the Lord,
Praise, brethren, praise!
What more befits the tongues .
Soon to join the angels' songs?-
Whilst heaven the note prolongs,
Praise, brethren, praise!
