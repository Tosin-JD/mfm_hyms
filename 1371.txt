Rescue -11.10.11.10. with Refrain

1.
Rescue the perishing, care for the dying,
Snatch them in pity from sin and grave,
Weep o'er the erring one, lift up the fallen.
Tell them of Jesus, the mighty to save.

CHORUS
Rescue the perishing, Care for the dying,
Jesus is merciful. Jesus will save

2.
Tho they are slighting Him. still He is waiting,
Waiting the penitent child to receive;
Plead with them earnestly, plead
with them gently.
He will forgive if they only believe.

3.
Down in the human heart, crushedby the tempter.
Feelings lie buried that grace can restore;
Touched by a loving heart, wakened by kindness.
Cords that are broken will vibrate once more

4.
Rescue the perishing, duty demands it
Strength for your labour the Lord will provide,
Back to the narrow way patiently win them,
Tell the poor wandâ€™rer a Savour had died

- Fanny J Crosby
