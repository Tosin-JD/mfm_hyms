Attainment - 8.7.8.7.D.

1.
Oh, this uttermost salvation!
'Tis a fountain full and free,
Pure, exhaustless, ever flowing.
Wondrous grace! It reaches me!

CHORUS
It reaches me! It reaches me!
Wondrous grace! it reaches me!
Pure, exhaustless, ever flowing,
Wondrous grace! it reaches me!

2.
How amazing Godâ€™s compassion,
That so vile a worm should prove
This stupendous bliss of heaven,
This unmeasured wealth of love!

3.
Jesus, Saviour, I adore Thee!
Now Thy love I will proclaim;
I will tell the blessed story,
I will magnify Thy name!

- Mary D. James
