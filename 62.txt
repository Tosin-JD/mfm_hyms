OH RENDER THANKS TO GOD ABOVE


1.
Oh render thanks to God above,
The fountain of eternal love,
Whose mercy firm through ages past
Has stood, and shall for ever last.

2.
Who can His mighty deeds express,
Not only vast, but numberless?
What mortal eloquence can raise
His tribute of immortal praise?

3.
Happy are they, and only they,
Who from His judgements fear to stray
Who know and love His perfect will,
And all His righteous laws fulfil.

4.
Extend to me that favour, Lord,
Thou to Thy chosen dost afford;
When Thou returnâ€™st to set them free,
Let Thy salvation visit me.
