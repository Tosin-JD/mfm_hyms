Come, let us all unite to sing

1.
Come, let us all unite to sing
God is love:
While heav'n and earth their praises bring
God is love!
Let ev'ry soul from sin awake,
Each in his heart sweet music make,
And sweetly sing for Jesus' sake
God is love!

CHORUS
God is love, God is love
Come, let us all unite to sing:
God is love!

2.
Oh, tell to earth’s remotest bound,
God is love!
In Christ is full redemption found
God is love!
His blood can cleanse our sins away;
His Spirit turns our night to day.
And leads our souls with joy to say
God is love!

3.
How happy is our portion here
God is love!
His promises our spirits cheer
God is love!
He is our Sun and Shield by day,
Our help, our hope, our strength,our stay,
He will be with us all the way
God is love!

4.
God is love!
What though my heart and flesh shall fail
Through Christ I shall o’er death prevail
God is love!
E'en Jordan's swell I will not fear,
For Jesus will be with me there.
My soul above the waves to bear
God is love!
