Jena - L.M.

1.
Wherewith, O God, shall I draw near,
And bow myself before Thy face?
How in Thy purer eyes appear?
What shall I bring to gain Thy grace?

2.
Who’er to Thee themselves approve
Must take the path Thy word hath showed.
Justice pursue, and mercy love.
And humbly walk by faith with God.

3.
But though my life henceforth be Thine,
Present for past can ne’er atone;
Though I to Thee the whole resign,
I only give Thee back Thine own.

1.
What have I then wherein to trust?
I nothing have, I nothing am;
Excluded is my every boast,
My glory swallowed up in shame.

2.
Guilty I stand before Thy face,
On me I feel Thy wrath abide;
“Tis just the sentence should take place;
Tis just but O Thy Son hath died.

3.
Jesus, the Lamb of God, hath bled.
He bore our sins upon the tree;
Beneath our curse He bowed His head;
Tis finished! He hath died for me!

4.
See where before the throne He stands,
And pours the all prevailing prayer.
Points to His side, and lifts His hands,
And shows that I am graven there.

5.
He ever lives for me to pray;
He prays that I with Him may reign:
Amen to what my Lord doth say!
Jesus, Thou canst not pray in vain.

- Charles Wesley
