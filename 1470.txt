When This Passing World Is Done - 7.7.7.7.7.6,

1.
When this passing world is done,
When has sunk you glaring sun,
When we stand with Christ in glory,
Looking o’er life’s finish'd story,
The, Lord, shall I fully know
Not till then, how much I owe.

2.
When I stand before the throne,
Dress'd in beauty not my own;
When I see Thee as Thou art,
Love Thee with unsinning heart;
Then, Lord, shall I fully know,
Not till then, how much I owe.

3.
When the praise of heaven I hear,
Loud as thunders to the ear
Loud as many waters’ noise,
Sweet as harp’s melodious voice;
Then, Lord, shall I fully know,
Not till then, how much I owe.

4.
Even on earth, as through a glass,
Darkly, let Thy glory pass;
Make forgiveness feel so sweet,
Make Thy spirit's help so meet;
Even on earth, Lord, make me know
Something of how much I owe.

5.
Chosen not for good in me,
Waken’d up form wrath to flee.
Hidden in the Saviour’s side.
By the Spirit sanctified,
Teach me. Lord, on earth to show
By my love how much I owe
