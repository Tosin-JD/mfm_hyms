Austrian Hymn - 8.7.8.7.D.

1.
We are living , we are dwelling
In a grand and awful time,
In an age on ages telling;
To be living is sublime.
Hark! the waking up of nations,
Hosts advancing to the fray;
Hark! what soundeth is creation's
Groaning for the latter day.

2.
Will ye play, then? will ye dally
Far behind the battle line?
Up! it is Jehovah’s rally;
God’s own arm hath need of thine.
Worlds are charging, heaven beholding;
Thou hast but an hour to fight;
Now, the blazoned cross unfolding,
On, right onward for the right!

3.
Sworn to yield, to waver, never,
Consecrated, born again;
Sworn to be Christ’s soldiers ever,
On! for Christ at least be men!
On! let all the soul within you
For the truth s sake go abroad!
Strike! let every nerve and sinew
Tell on ages tell for God.
