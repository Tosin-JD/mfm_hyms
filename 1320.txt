The Healer

1.
On the Cross crucified,
In great sorrow He died;
The Giver of life was He.
Yet my Lord was despised
and rejected of men.
This Jesus of Calvary.

CHORUS
He was wounded for our
trangressions,
He was bruis'd for our iniquities;
Surely He bore our sorrows,
And by His stripes we are healed.

2.
Price for healing was paid.
As those cruel stripes we made,
Within Pilate’s judgement hall.
Now His suff’ring affords
perfect healing for all.
This wonderful Healer’s mine.

3.
Came the leper to Christ,
Saying “Surely I know,
That Thou, Lord, canst make me whole."
When His great faith was seen
Jesus said “Yes, I will.”
And touch’d him and made him clean.

4.
He has healed my sick soul.
Made me ev’ry whit whole,
And He’ll do the same for you.
He’s the same yesterday
and today and for aye,
This Healer of men today.
