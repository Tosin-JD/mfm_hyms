Petition-7.6.7.6.D.

1.
Sometimes a light surprises
The Christian while he sings;
It is the Lord Who rises
With healing in His wings:
When comforts are declining.
He grants the soul again
A season of clear shining,
To cheer it after rain.

2.
In holy contemplation,
We sweetly then
The theme of Godâ€™s salvation,
And find it ever new.
Set free from present sorrow.
We cheerfully can say,
E'en let the unknown tomorrow
Bring with it what it may:

3.
It can bring with it nothing
But He will bear us through;
Who gives the lilies clothing
Will clothe His people too:
Beneath the spreading heavens
And He who feeds the ravens
Will give His children bread.

4.
Though vine or fig-tree neither
Their wonted fruit should bear,
Though all the field should wither,
Nor flocks nor herds be there,
Yet. God the same abiding,
His praise shall tune my voice;
For, while in Him confiding,
I cannot but rejoice.

- W. Cowper
