Leave Your Burdens At The Place Of Prayer

1.
When the clouds’, are hanging low,
When the raging tempests blow,
When your soul is burdened with its
weight of care;
There’s a place of perfect rest,
Where no evil can molest;
Leave your burden at the place of
prayer.
CHORUS
Leave you burden at the place of
prayer.
Take to Jesus all your want and
care;
For He is a Friend indeed,
And supplieth every need;
Leave your burden at the place of
prayer.

2.
There is rest for you today,
Tho’ you walk life’s busy way,
There is One who waits your heavy
load to bear;
Jesus understands your need
Your petition He will heed;
Leave your burden at the place of
prayer
3 Bring your load of doubts and fears,
All the burdens of the years,
You may meet your Saviour and His
blessings share;
Bring your troubles not a few.
Jesus will your strength renew;
Leave your burden at the place of
prayer.

4.
We shall soon from care be free,
With our eyes His glory see,
O the blessedness of peace
awaiting there;
Till that glorious day has come,
Till your race on earth is done;
Leave your burden at the place of
prayer.-Bertha Mae Lillenas
