Old Things Have Passed Away

1.
Jesus on Calvary Died in my place,
Saved to the uttermost, Wonderful grace.
I saw him lifted up, My heart He drew,
Old things have passed away,
All things are new.

CHORUS
Old things have passed away,
All things are new,
Old things have passed away. 
All things are new;
Jesus my Saviour, Saves me thro’ and thro’,
Old things have passed away,
All things are new.

2.
Tho’ I was far away, He saw my need,
His Spirit touched my heart,
Caused me to plead,
His Name above all names. His work so true,
Old things have passed away,
All things are new.

3.
My heart in tune with His, Fellow ship,
His joy He gives to me. My joy complete.
Thro’ all eternity, His face I’ll view,
Old things have passed away,
All things are new.
