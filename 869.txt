Simeon – L. M.

1.
Come, sinners, to the gospel feast.
Let ev'ry soul be Jesus guest;
Ye need not one be left behind,
For God hath bidden all mankind.

2.
Sent by my Lord, on you I call;
The invitation is to all:
Come, all the world; come, sinner, thou!
All things in Christ are ready now.

3.
Come, a ye souls by sin op pressed
Ye restless wanderers after rest.
Ye poor, and maimed, and halt, and blind,
In Christ E hearty welcome find.

4.
His love is mighty to compel;
His conquering love consent to fee!
Yield to His love’s resistless power
And fight against your God no more

5.
This is the time; no more delay!
This is the Lord’s accepted day;
Come in, this moment, at His call.
And live for Him who died for all.

- C. Wesley
