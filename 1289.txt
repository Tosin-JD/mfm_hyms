There Is A Path That Leads To God - C. M.

1.
There is a path that leads to God,
All others go astray;
Narrow but pleasant is the road
And Christians love the way.

2.
It leads straight through this world of sin.
And dangers must be passed;
But those who boldly walk therein,
Will get to heaven at last.

3.
How shall an infant pilgrim dare
This dangerous path to tread?
For on the way is many a snare
For youthful travellers spread.

4.
While the broad road, wherethousand go,
Lies near and opens fair;
And many turn aside, I know,
To walk with sinners there.

5.
But lest feeble steps should slide,
Or wander from Thy way,
Lord, condescend to be my guide,
And I shall never stray.

6.
Then I may go without alarm
And trust His word of old,
“The lambs, He'll gather with His arm
And lead them to the fold.’

7.
Thus I may safely venture through
Beneath my Shepherd’s care,
And keep the gate of heaven in view,
Till I shall enter there.
