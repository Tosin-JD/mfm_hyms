Running Over

1.
Since the Saviour came to this heart of mine,
My cup’s fill’d and running over,
Filling my poor soul with His joy divine.
My cup’s fill’d and running over.

CHORUS
Running over, Running over,
My cup’s fill’d and running over,
Since the Lord saved me, I’m as happy as can be,
My cup’s fill'd and running over.

2.
With my Lord so dear, I have naught to fear,
My cup’s fill'd and running over,
Tho’ my way be drear He is ever near,
My cup’s fill’d and running over.

3.
Even tho' I walk thro’ death's darksome vale,
My cup’s fill’d and running over,
Christ my Lord shall be my comfort still,
My cup’s fill’d and running over.

4.
Sinner, seek the Lord, trust His precious word.
While the angels round you hover.
Heaven’s bells will ring, and you then will sing.
My cup’s fill’d and running over.
