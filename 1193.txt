1.
I Gave My life for thee,
My precious blood I shed,
That thou might’st ransom’d be,
And quicken’d from the dead.
0 gave My life for thee:
What hast thou given for Me?

2.
I spent long years for thee,
In weariness and woe.
That an eternityOf joy thou mightest know,
I spent long years for thee, '
Has thou spent one for Me?

3.
My Father’s home of light.
My rainbow-circled throne,
I left for earthly night.
For wanderings sad and lone.
I left it all for thee;
Hast thou left aught for Me?

4.
I suffer’d much for thee.
More than thy tongue can tell,
Of bitterest agony,
To rescue thee from hell.
I suffer’d much for thee;
What canst thou bear for Me?

5.
And I have brought to thee,
Down from My home above.
Salvation full and free,
My pardon and My love,
Great gifts I brought to thee;
What hast thou brought to Me?

6.
Ofy let thy life be given.
Thy years for Me be spent,
World-fetters all be riven.
And joy with suffering blent.
I gave Myself for thee;
Give thou thyself to Me.
