Fulda -8.8.8.8.

1.
We have a gospel to proclaim,
good news for men in all the earth;
the gospel of a Saviour’s name:
we sing his glory, tell his worth.

2.
Tell of his birth of Bethlehem,
not in a royal house or hall
but in a stable dark and .dim:
the Word made flesh, a light for all.

3.
Tell of his death at Calvary,
hated by those he came to save;
in lonely suffering on the cross
for all he loved, his life he gave.

4.
Tell of that glorious Easter morn:
empty the tomb, for he was free;
he broke the power of death and
hell
that we might share his victory.

5.
Tell of his reign at God’s right hand,
by all creation glorified;
he sends his Spirit on his church
to live for him the lamb who died.

6.
Now we rejoice to name him king:
Jesus is Lord of all the earth;
this gospel message we proclaim:
we sing his glory, tell his worth.

- E J. Burns
