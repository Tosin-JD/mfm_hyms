64
St. Stephen - C.M.

1.
When all Thy mercies, O my God,
My rising soul surveys,
Transported with the view, I’m lost
In wonder, love, and praise.

2. Unnumbered comforts to my soul
Thy tender care bestow’d,
Before my infant heart conceived
From whom these comforts flow’d.

3.
When worn with sickness, oft hast Thou
With health renew’d my face;
And, when in sins and sorrows sunk,
Revived my soul with grace.

4.
Ten thousand thousand precious gifts
My daily thanks employ;
Nor is the least a cheerful heart,
That tastes those gifts with joy.

5.
Through every period of my life
Thy goodness I'll pursue;
And after death, in distant worlds,
The glorious theme renew.

6.
Through all eternity to Thee
A joyful song I’ll raise:
For oh! eternity’s too short
To utter all Thy praise.
