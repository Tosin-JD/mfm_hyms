JESUS COMMANDS THAT WE SHOULD WATCH -CM.

1.
Jesus commands that we should watch
Every hour of the day,
He sends a revival to those
Who pray for revival.

2.
Jesus commands that we should pray
To fight on and not faint,
O Lord, make us to hear Thy call,
Obedience is our life.

3.
Jesus commands that we should watch
The hour is near at hand
That He shall call us from this world
To our home up in heavâ€™n.

4.
Jesus, we love to pray to Thee
We love to hear Thy voice
We love to walk in Thy precepts
To where joy never ends.
