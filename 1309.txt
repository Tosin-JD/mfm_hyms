Jesus Knows Thy Sorrow - 6.5.

1.
Jesus knows thy sorrow,
Knows thine ev'ry care;
Knows thy deep contrition.
Hears thy feeblest prayer;
Do not fear to trust Him
Tell Him all thy grief;
Cast on Him thy burden,
He will bring relief.

2.
Trust the heart of Jesus.
Thou art precious there;
Surely he would shield thee
From the tempterâ€™s snare;
Safely He would lead thee.
By His own sweet way,
Out into the glory
Of a brighter day.

3.
Jesus knows thy conflict,
Hears thy burdened sigh;
When thy heart is wounded,
Hears thy plainative cry:
He thy soul will strengthen,
Overcome thy fears,
He will send thee comfort,
Wipe away thy tears.

- Rev. W. O. Cushing
