Kum Ba Yah - 8.8.8.5.

1.
Father God in heaven, Lord most high:
hear your childrenâ€™s prayer, Lord most high:
hallowed be your name, Lord most high
O Lord, hear our prayer,

2.
May your kingdom come here on earth;
may your will be done here on earth,
as it is in heaven so on earth
O Lord, hear our prayer.

3.
Give us daily bread day by day,
and forgive our sins day by day.
as we too forgive day by day
O Lord, hear our prayer.

4.
Lead us in your way, make us strong;
when temptations come make us strong;
save us from all sin, keep us strong
O Lord, hear our prayer.

5.
All things come from you, all are yours
kingdom, glory, power, all are yours:
take our lives and gifts, all are yours
O Lord, hear our prayer.

- James E. Seddon
