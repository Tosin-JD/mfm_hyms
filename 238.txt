238
Just obey

1.
Just as God who reigns on high
Spake to men in days gone by,
So the Lord is calling men today;
And, my brother this is true,
Whatsoe’er he says to you,
There is but one thing to do just obey.

CHORUS
Just obey, just obey Is the way, God’s way;
When his message comes to you.
There is but one thing to do,
Just obey, just obey.

2.
If you’re in the Saviour’s hands’,
You must do as he commands,
For there is no other gospel way;
Never put the message by,
Never stop to reason ’’why,’’
When the Saviour speaks to you
just obey.

3.
If for mansions fair you sigh
In that land beyond the sky,
After time with you has pass’d away;
Tho' the way you may not see,
Christ is calling, “follow me,”
Faith and duty still will cry just obey.

- Rev. Johnson Oatman, Jr.
