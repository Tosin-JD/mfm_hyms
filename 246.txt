246
Dearer than all

1.
Ye who the love of a mother have known,
There is a love sweeter far you may own,
Love all sufficient for sin to atone;
Jesus is dearer than all.

CHORUS
Dearer than all, yes, dearer than all,
He is my King, before Him I fall;
No friend like Jesus my soul can enthral,
Jesus is dearer far dearer than all.

2.
Jesus entreats you in Him to confide,
Make Him your constant companion and guide;
He can do more than the whole world beside;
Jesus is dearer than all.

3.
Heaven, with all of its beauty so rare.
With my Redeemer can never compare;
He is the glory transcendent up there;
Jesus is dearer than all.
