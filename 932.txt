932
The Army of the Living God.

1.
Hark! On the highway of life a sound,
As crested waves of Ocean roar,
Lash’d by the storm in its fury spent,.
As they beat upon the shore.

CHORUS
Hark! the tramp, tramp, tramp of the army
as they march along the way of life,
They are weary of the toil and the travel,
of the bitterness of strife (of strife)
But they hope and trust looking ever
on the path the saints before have trod,
And as they march along their faith grows
strong in the church of the living God.

2.
Onward they march with a faith unmoved
By any change of time or creed;
Their’s to believe that the word ofGod
Can supply the world’s great need.

3.
Step in the ranks, you are needed there,
Cling to the church and God will bless;
He is the hope of the whole wide world
For the cause of righteousness.

- C. Austin Miles
