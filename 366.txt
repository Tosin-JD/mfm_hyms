The Mercies of God

1.
The mercies of God! what a theme for my song,
Oh! I never could number them o’er,
They’re more than the stars in the heavenly dome.
Or the sands of the wave beaten shore.

CHORUS
For mercies so great, what return can I make?
For mercies so constant and sure?
I’ll love Him, I’ll serve Him with all that I have
As long as my life shall endure.

2.
They greet me at morn when I waken from sleep.
And they gladden my heart at the noon;
They follow me on into shades of the night
When the day with its labour is done.

3.
His angels of mercy encompass me ‘round,
Wheresoever my pathway lead;
Each turn of the road some new token reveals
Oh! for me life is blessed indeed.

4.
His goodness and mercy will follow me still,
Even on to the end of the way,
I have His sure promise and that cannot fail,
That His mercy endureth for aye.

- T. O. Chisholm
