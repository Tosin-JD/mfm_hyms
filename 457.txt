Verily, I Say Unto You

1.
Oh, what a Saviour that He died for me!
From condemnation He hath made me free;
“He that believeth on the Son,” said He,
“Hath everlasting life.” 

CHORUS
“Verily, verily, I say unto you;
verily, verily,” message ever new!
“He that believeth on the Son” tis true!
“Hath everlasting life!”

2.
All my iniquities on Him were laid,
All my indebtedness by Him was paid;
All who believe on Him, the Lord hath said,
“Hath everlasting life.”

3.
Though poor and needy, I can trust my Lord;
Though weak and sinful. I believe His Word;
O glad message! Every child of God
“Hath everlasting life.”

4.
Though all unworthy, yet I will not doubt;.
For him that cometh He will not cast out:
“He that believeth,” oh, the good news shout!
“Hath everlasting life.”
