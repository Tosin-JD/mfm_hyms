1125
After

1.
After the toil and the heat of the day,
After my troubles are past,
After the sorrows are taken away,
I shall see Jesus at last.

CHORUS
He will be waiting for me
Jesus, so kind and true:
On His beautiful throne,
He will welcome me home
After the day is through.

2.
After the heart aches and sighing shall cease,
After the cold winter’s blast,
After the conflicts comes glorious peace,
I shall see Jesus at last.

3.
After the shadows of evening shall fall,
After my anchor is cast,
After I list to my Savior’s last call,
I shall see Jesus at last.

- N. B. Vandall
