Bethesda - 8.6.8.8.6.

1.
O Saviour Christ, at Thy behest
We gather in Thy Name
As humble suppliants, to be blest.
That in our need so full confessed
Thy healing pow'r may claim,

2.
Behold the sick, the blind the lame!
To whom else can we go?
Oh, show to us Thou art the same
As when Thy touch healed all who came
Thy freedom full to know.

3.
For Thou didst share in days of yore
Our sorrow and our woe;
Oh, who can tell Thine anguish sore,
That from Thy stripes and wounds may pour
A cleansing, healing flow.

4.
Thou didst the perfect work complete:
Our all is found in Thee!
The scars so deep in hands and feet
Are pledge of our redemption sweet,
Deliverance full and free.

5.
Our dear High Priest, on Thee we wait,
Thou sympathising Friend.
Thyself dost feel our weak estate;
Do Thou, in Thy compassion great,
Thy grace to each extend.

6.
Thy wondrous virtue now impart:
Thy healing power display!
Bid doubt and anxious fear depart,
Inspiring faith in every heart
Thy gift to claim this day.

7.
O touch our-eyes: so shall we see
That Thou art by our side.
Restored and quickened shall we be,
And blessed with perfect liberty,
Shall in Thy life abide.
