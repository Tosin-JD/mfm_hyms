301
Come not to tarry, but stay

1.
My heart is open to thee, dear Lord,
Come in, come in;
My faith is clinging to thy dear word,
Come in come in.

CHORUS
Come not to tarry, but stay, dear Lord,
All shall be thine love can afford,
Here in my heart ever make thineabode,
Come in come in.

2.
Yes, there is room in my heart, dear Lord,
Come in, come in;
Thy presence makes heaven real to me,
Come in, come in.

3.
I kept thee standing outside so long.
Come in, come in;
I pray thee pardon this shameful wrong,
Come in, come in.

3.
I hear thee knocking at my heart’s door,
Come in, come in.
I’ll keep thee waiting outside no more,
Come in, come in.
