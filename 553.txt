Showers of Blessing - 8.7.8.7. and Refrain

1.
Here in Thy name we are gathered,
Come and revive us, O Lord;
“There shall be showers of blessing,”
Thou hast declar’d in Thy word.

CHORUS
Oh, graciously hear us,
Graciously hear us we pray:
Pour from Thy windows upon us
Showers of blessing today

2.
Oh! that the showers of blessing
Now on our souls may descend,
While at the footstool of mercy
Pleading Thy promise we bend!

3.
“There shall be showers of blessing,”
Promise that never can fail;
Thou wilt regard our petition;
Surely our faith will prevail.

4.
Showers of blessing, we need them,
Showers of blessing from Thee;
Showers of blessing, oh, grant them,
Thine all the glory shall be.
