Morgenglanz der Ewigkeit - 7.7.7.3.

1.
‘Christian, seek not yet repose,’
Hear thy guardian Angel say;
Thou art in the midst of foes:
Watch and pray!’

2.
Principalities and powers,
Mustering their unseen array,
Wait for thy unguarded hours:
Watch and pray!’

3.
Gird thy heavenly armour on.
Wear it ever, night and day;
Ambushed lies the evil one:
Watch and pray!’

4.
Hear the victors who o’ercome;
Still they mark each warrior’s way;
All with one sweet voice exclaim;
Watch and pray!'

5.
Hear, above all, hear thy Lord,
Him thou lovest to obey;
Hide within thy heart his word:
Watch and pray!'

6.
Watch, as if on that alone
Hung the issue of the day;
Pray, that help may be sent down:
Watch and pray!’
