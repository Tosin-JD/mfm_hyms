Worcester - 8.7.8.7.4.

1.
Glory be to God the Father
Glory be to God the Son,
Glory be to God the Spirit,
Great Jehovah, Three in One:
Glory, glory,
While eternal ages run!

2.
Glory be to Him who loved us,
Wash'd us from each spot and stain;
Glory be to Him who bought us,
Made us kings with Him to reign:
Glory, glory,
To the Lamb that once was slain!

3.
Glory to the King of angels,
Glory to the church's King,
Glory to the King of nations;
Heaven and earth your praises bring:
Glory, glory,
To the King of glory bring!

4.
Glory, blessing, praise eternal,
Thus the choir of angels sings;
Honour, riches, power, dominion,
Thus it's praise creation brings:
Glory, glory,
Glory to the King of kings!
