Home Beautiful Home

1.
There is a Home eternal
Beautiful and bright
where sweet joys supernal
Never are dimm'd by night
Ever around the bright throne;
When, oh, when shall I see thee,
Beautiful, beautiful! Home?

CHORUS
Home! Beautiful Home!
Bright, beautiful Home!
Bright, Home of our Saviour
Bright, beautiful Home!

2.
Flowers are ever springing
In that Home so fair,
Little children singing
Praises to Jesus there.
How they swell the glad anthem,
Ever around the bright throne!
when, oh, when shall I see thee,
Beautiful, beautiful Home?

3.
Soon shall I join the ransomed,
far beyond the sky;
Christ is my salvation,
Why should I fear to die?
soon my eyes shall behold Him
Seated upon the bright throne;
Then, oh, then shall I see thee,
Beautiful, beautiful Home!
