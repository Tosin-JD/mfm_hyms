Heaven Came Down - Irregular

1.
O what a wonderful, wonderful day
Day I will never forget;
After I’d wandered in darkness away,
Jesus my Saviour I met.
O what a tender compassionate friend
He met the need of my heart;
Shadows dispelling, With joy I am telling,
He made all the darkness depart!

CHORUS
Heaven came down and glory filled my soul,
When at the cross the Saviour made me whole;
My sins were washed away
And my night was turned to day
Heaven came down and glory filled my soul!

2.
Born of the Spirit with life from above
Into God’s family divine,
Justified fully thro’ Calvary’s love,
O what a standing is mine!
And the transaction so quickly was made
When as a sinner I came,
Took of the offer Of grace He did proffer
He saved me, O praise His dear name!

3.
Now I’ve a hope that will surely endure
After the passing of time;
I have a future in heaven for sure,
There in those mansions sub-lime.
And it’s because of that wonderful day
When at the cross I believed;
Riches eternal And blessings supernal
From His precious hand I received.
