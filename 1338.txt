Work, While ‘tis Day

1.
Work, time is passing, the hours quickly fly;
Work while the sunlight is beaming on high;
Waste not the moments, for night draweth nigh,
Soon you shall labour no more.

CHORUS
Work, toiler, work, there is labour for you!
Work, toiler, work, to His service be true!
Work while ’tis day, Work while you may
Work, toiler, work for Jesus!

2.
Faithfully labour with head and with hand.
Ever obeying the Master’s command;
Though you the purpose may not understand,
Work, for the day’s flying fast.

3.
Work, for beside thee he standeth to bless;
He will direct thee thro’ earth’s wilderness;
God will protect thee, no foes shall oppress;
Work for Him, then, while you may.

4.
Jesus, thy Master, has gone to prepare
In His blest kingdom a home bright and fair;
Rest there awaits you, His joy thou shalt share:
Work, then, the day soon is gone.
