Serving Him truly

1.
It pays to serve Jesus. I speak from my heart;
He’ll always be with us if we do our
part;There’s naught in this wide world can pleasure afford,
There’s peace and contentment 'in serving the Lord.’

2.
And oft when I'm tempted to turn from the track,
I think of my Saviour, my mind wanders back
To the place where they nail'd Him on
Calvary's tree I hear a voice saying: I suffer’d for thee.

3.
A place I remember where I was set free,
'Twas where I found pardon, a heaven to me;
There Jesus spoke sweetly to my weary soul,
My sins were forgiven, He made my heart whole.

4.
How rich is the blessing the world cannot give,
I'm satisfied fully for Jesus to live,
Tho’ friends may forsake me and trials arise,
I’m trusting in Jesus, His love never dies.

5.
There’s no one like Jesus can cheer me today,
His love and His kindness can ne’er fade away;
In winter, in summer, in sunshine and rain,
His love and affection are always the same.

6.
Will you have this blessing that Jesus bestows?
A free, full salvation for sin’s bitter throes,
O come to the Saviour, to Calvary's tree!
The fountain is open'd, is flowing for thee.
