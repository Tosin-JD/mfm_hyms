S. Petersburg - L.M.

1.
Awake, our souls, away, our fears!
Let every trembling thought be gone!
Awake, and run the heavenly race,
And put a cheerful courage on.

2.
True, ‘tis a strait and thorny road,
And mortal spirits tire and faint;
But they forget the mighty God
That feeds the strength of every saint.

3.
O mighty God, thy matchless power
Is ever new and ever young,
And firm endures, while endless years
Their everlasting circles run.

4.
From thee, the ever-flowing spring,
Our souls shall drink a fresh supply;
While such as trust their native strength
Shall melt away and droop and die.

5.
Swift as the eagle cuts the air,
We’ll mount aloft to thine abode;
On wings of love our souls shall fly,
Nor tire along the heavenly road.

- Isaac Watts
