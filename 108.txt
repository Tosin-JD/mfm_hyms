Gounod - 8.7.8.7.7.7.

1.
Morning comes with light all-cheering,
Shades of night have fled apace;
Source of light, by Thine appearing,
From our minds all darkness chase:
Thou hast blest us in our sleep;
Through the day direct and keep.

2.
Earth refreshed Thy praise is
sounding,All Thy works Thy glory sing;
May our hearts, with love abounding,
Gratefully their tribute bring:
Thou hast taught the birds their lays;
Teach our hearts to sing Thy praise.

3.
All day long to praise Thee help us,
And to strive against all sin;
Finding all our help in Jesus,
Who for us the fight did win:
He was tempted here below,
And doth all our weakness know.

4.
Man goes to his work till evening
Brings again the needed rest;
Grant that we, Thy grace receiving,
May in all we do be blest:
And wherever we may be
Find our joy in pleasing Thee.

- James Englebert Vanner
