Bringing ln The Sheaves

1.
Sowing in the morning, sowing seeds of kindness.
Sowing in the noon tide and the dewy eve;-
Waiting for the harvest, and the  time of reaping,
We shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves.

CHORUS
Bringing in the sheaves, bringing in the sheaves,
We Shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves;
Bringing in the sheaves, bringing in the sheaves-,
We shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves

2.
Sowing in the sunshine, sowing in the shadows,
Fearing neither clouds nor winter’s chilling breeze;
By and by the harvest and the labour ended.
We shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves.

3.
Going forth with weeping, sowing for the Master,
Tho' the Ibss sustained our spirit of ten grieves;
When our weeping’s over, He will bid us welcome,
We shall come rejoicing, bringing inthe sheaves.
