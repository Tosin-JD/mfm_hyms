St. Mary Tavy - 8.8.8.8.8.8.

1.
O Thou whose wondrous love had given
Thine own and only Son for man,
Ere shone the earliest star in heaven
Or earth was framed or time began,
And chosen us in Him to be
His bride for all eternity.

2.
Thou, who hast deign’d for us to build
The mansions of Jerusalem,
With all Thy gifts of goodness fill’d
And rich with crystal gold and gem,
Whose gates and walls and streets declare
One glorious name, ‘The Lord is there;

3.
Now in this little space between
Two vast eternities of love,
This narrow is isthmus of things seen
Thy children cross to rest above,
Wilt Thou refuse to be our guide
And all our daily needs provide?

4.
Oh shame upon the faithless heart
Which harbours such a thought of Thee!
My God, that Thou art what Thou art
Is promise, aye and proof to me
While passing through this shadowy vale
The cruse of oil shall never fail.

5.
From everlasting I am Thine
In Thy free covenant of grace;
To everlasting Thou art mine
In faith’s response and love’s
embraceThe life our Father gave and plann’d
Is safe in His Almighty hand.

- Joseph Barby
