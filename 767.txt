Caithness - C. M.

1.
Search me, O God! my actions try,
And let my life appear
As seen by Thine all searching eye;
To mine my ways make clear.

2.
Search all my sense, and know my heart,
Who only canst make known,
And let the deep, the hidden part
To me be fully shown.

3.
Throw light into the darkened cells,
Where passion reigns within;
Quicken my conscience till it feels
The loathsomeness of sin.

4.
Search, till Thy fiery glance has cast
Its holy light through all.
And I by grace am brought at last
Before Thy face to fall.

5.
Thus prostrate I shall learn of Thee,
What now I feebly prove,
That God alone in Christ can be
Unutterable love!

- Francis Bottome
