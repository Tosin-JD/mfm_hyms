Tallisâ€™ canon - L. M.

1.
God moves in a mysterious way
His glorious wonders to perform;
He plants His foot-steps in the sea,
And rides upon the raging storm.

2.
Deep in unfathomable mines
Of never-failing skill.
He treasures up His bright designs.
And works His sovereign will.

3.
Ye fearful saints, fresh courage sake;
The clouds ye so much dread
Are big with mercy, and shall break
In blessings on your head.

4.
Judge not the Lord by feeble sense.
But trust Him for His grace:
Behind a frowning providence
He hides a smiling face.

5.
His purpose will ripen fast.
Unfolding every hour;
The bud may have a bitter taste.
But sweet will be the flower

- William Cowper
