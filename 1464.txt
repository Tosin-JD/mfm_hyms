1.
Jesus, with Thy church abide,
Be her Saviour. Lord, and Guide,

Arms of love around her throw.
Shield her safe from every foe.

Keep her life and doctrine pure.
Help her, patient to endure.
Trusting in Thy promise sure:
We beseech Thee, hear us

Be Thou with her all the days,
May she safe from error's ways,
Toil for Thine eternal praise:
We beseech Thee, hear us.

5.
May her voice be ever clear.
Warning of a judgement near,

All her ruin'd works repair,
Build again Thy temple fair,

Seek the lost until she find,
And broken hearted bind:

Save her love from growing cold.
Make her watchmen strong and bold,
Fence her round Thy peaceful fold
We beseech Thee, hear us.

May her priests Thy people feed.
Shepherds of the flock indeed,
Ready, where they call to lead:
We beseech Thee, hear us.

May they live the truths they know,
And a holy pattern show,
As before Thy flock they go:
We beseech Thee, hear us.

May the grace of Him who died.
Arid the Father's love abide,
And the Spirit ever guide:
We beseech Thee, hear us.

15.All her evil purge away,
All her doubts and fears allay,
Hasten, Lord, her triumph day:
We beseech Thee, hear us.

16.
Help her in her time of fast,
Till her toil and woe are past.
And the Bridegroom come at last.
We beseech Thee, hear us.

17.
May she then all glorious be.
Spotless and from wrinkle free,
Pure and bright and worthy Thee:
We beseech Thee, hear us.

18.
Fit her all Thy joy to share,
In the home Thou dost prepare.
And be ever blessed there:
We beseech Thee, hear us.
