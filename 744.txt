My Prayer

1.
More holiness give me,
More striving within;
More patience in suffering,
More sorrow for sin;
More faith in my Saviour,
More sense of His care;
More joy in His service,
More purpose in prayer.

2.
More gratitude give me,
More trust in the Lord;
More pride in His glory,
More hope in His Word;
More tears for His sorrows,
More pain at His grief;
More meekness in trial,
More praise for relief.

3.
More purity give me,
More strength to o'er come;
More freedom from earth stains.
More longings for home;
More fit for the kingdom,
More used would I be;
More blessed and holy,
More, Saviour, like Thee.
