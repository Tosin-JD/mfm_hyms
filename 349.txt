I am Happy in Him

1.
My soul is so happy in Jesus,
For He is so precious to me;
His voice it is music to hear it,
His face it is heaven to see.

CHORUS
I am happy in Him, I am happy in Him;
My soul with delight He fills day and night,
For I am happy in Him.

2.
He sought me so long ere I knew Him,
When wand'ring afar from the fold;
Safe home in His arms He hath bro't me,
To where there are pleasures untold.

3.
His love and His mercy surround me,
His grace like a river doth flow;
His Spirit, to guide and to comfort,
Is with me wherever I go.

4.
They say I shall some day be like Him
My cross and my burdens laydown;
Till then I will ever be faithful,
In gathering gems for His crown.

- E. O. Excell
