1.
March on, my soul, with strength,
March forward, void of fear;
He who hath led will lead,
While year succeedeth year;
And as thou goest on thy way,
His hand shall hold thee day by day.

2.
March on, my soul; with strength,
In ease thou darâ€™st not dwell;
High duty calls thee forth;
Then up, and quit thee well!
Take up thy cross, take up thy
sword,
And fight the battles of thy Lord!

3.
March on, my soul, with strength,
With strength, but not thine own;
The conquest thou shalt gain,
Through Christ thy Lord alone;
His grace shall nerve thy feeble
arm,His love preserve thee save from
harm.

4.
March on, my soul, with strength,
From strength to strength march
on;
Warfare shall end at length.
All foes be overthrown.
Then, O my soul, if faithful now.
The crown of life awaits thy brow


- William Wright
