545
Begin in me

1.
O Lord, in me Thy work revive,
Begin this very hour;
Oh, may my eyes in rapture see
Thy Spirit mighty power!

CHORUS
Begin in me, begin in me
Thy work of love and power
O Spirit of the living God,
Begin this very hour.

2.
Thy weary Church has waited long
May it not wait in vain;
Break throâ€™ the darksome clouds we dread.
And send refreshing rain.

3.
Might but a shower of grace descend,
Our hearts would lose their gloom;
The barren hills would all rejoice,
The wilderness would bloom.
