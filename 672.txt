Passion Chorale - 7.6.7.6.D.

1.
Commit thou all that grieves thee
And fills thy heart with care
To him whose faithful mercy
The skies above declare,
Who gives the winds their courses,
Who points the clouds their way;
'Tis he will guide thy footsteps
And be thy staff and stay.

2.
O trust the Lord then wholly.
If thou" would'st be secure;
His work must thou consider
For thy work to endure.
What profit doth it bring there
To pine in grief and care?
God only ends his blessing
In answer to thy prayer.

3.
Thy lasting truth and mercy,
O Father, see arightThe needs of all thy children.
Their anguish or delight:
What loving wisdom chooseth,
Redeeming might will do,
And bring to sure fulfilment
Thy counsel good and true.

4.
Hope on, then, broken spirit;
Hop on, be no afraid:
Fear not the griefs that plague thee
And keep thy heart dismayed:
Thy God, in his great mercy,
Will save thee, hold thee fast,
And in his own time grant thee
The sun of joy at last.
