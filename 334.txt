He Took My Sins Away

1.
I came to Jesus, weary, worn, and sad,
He took my sins away, He took my sins away,
And now His love has made my heart, so glad,
He took my sins away.

CHORUS
He took my sins away, He took my sins away,
And keeps me singing ev’ry day!
I’m so glad He took my sins away,
He took my sins away.

2.
The load of sin was more than I could bear,
He took my sins away, He took my sins away,
And now on Him I roll ev'ry care,
He took my sins away.

3.
No condemnation have I in my heart,
He took my sins away, He took my sins away,
His perfect peace He did to me impart,
He took my sins away.

4.
If you will come to Jesus Christ today,
He took my sins away, He took my sins away,
And keep you happy in His love each day,
He took my sins away.
