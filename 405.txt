1.
Give of your best to the Master,
Give of the strength of your youth;
Throw your soul s fresh, glowing
ardour
Into the battle for truth.
Jesus has set the example;
Dauntless was He, young and
brave;
Give Him your loyal devotion,
Give Him the best that you have.
CHORUS
Give of your best to the Master,
Give of the strength of your youth;
Clad in salvation's full armour,
Join in the battle for truth.2. Give of your best to the Master.
Give Him first place in your heart;
Give Him first place in your service.
Consecrate ev'ry part.
Give and to you shall be given
God His beloved Son gave;
Gratefully seeking to serve Him,
Give Him the best that you have.

3.
Give of your best to the Master,
Nought else is worthy of His love;
He gave Himself for your ransom,
Gave up His glory above:
Laid down His life without murmur.
You from sin's ruin to save;
Give Him your heart's adoration,
Give Him the best that you have.
