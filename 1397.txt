Eatlngton - CM.

1.
The Church triumphant in thy love, ,
Their mighty joys we know,
They sing the Lamb in hymns above,
And we in. hymns below.

2.
Thee in thy glorious realm they praise,
And bow before thy throne;
We in the kingdom of thy grace:
The kingdom are but one.

3.
The holy to the holiest leads,
from hence our Spirits rise,
And he that in thy statues treads
Shall meet thee in the skies.

- Charles Wesley
