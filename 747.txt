St. Alkmund - L.M.

1.
Command Thy blessing from above,
O God, on all assembled here;
Behold us with a Father's love.
While we look up with filial fear.

2.
Command Thy blessing, Jesus, Lord.
May we Thy true disciples be;
Speak to each heart the mighty word;
Say to the weakest, Follow Me.

3.
Command Thy blessing, in this hour,
Spirit of truth, and fill this place
With humbling and with healing power,
With quickening and confirming grace.

4.
O Thou, our Maker, Saviour Guide,
One true Eternal God confess'd.
May nought in life or death divide
The saints in Thy communion bless'd.
