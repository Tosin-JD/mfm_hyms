Azmon - C. M.

1.
O for a thousand tongues to sing
My great Redeemer’s praise,
The glories of my God and King,
The triumphs of His grace.

2.
Jesus! the name that charms our fears,
That bids our sorrows cease,
“Tis music in the sinner’s ears,
Tis life and health and peace.

3.
He breaks the power of cancelled sin.
He sets the prisoner free;
His blood can make the foulest clean; .
His blood Availed for me.

4.
He speaks and, listening to His voice
New life the dead receive;
the mournful broken hearts rejoice
the humble poor believe.

5.
Hear Him, ye deaf; His praise, ye dumb,
Your loosened tongues employ;
Ye blind, behold your Saviour come;
And leap, ye lame, for joy.

6.
My gracious Master and my God,
Assist me to proclaim,
To spread thro’ all the earth abroad,
The honours of Thy name.

- Charles Wesley
