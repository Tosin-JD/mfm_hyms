Give Me A Gentle Heart - 6.4.6.4.6.6.6.4.

1.
Give me a gentle heart
Filled with meekness.
Diligent heart like Thine
Jesus, my Lord
Humbleness and patience
A heart of compassion
In every small detail
To be like Him.

2.
Give me contentment in
All conditions
Be it e’en humbler than
His lowly birth
Give me Thou Thy comfort
Give me also thy help
In every small detail
To be like Him.

3.
Give me enthusiasm
In things of Thine
Earnestness and more love
For things of heav’n
Give me hatred for sin
Give me also Thy help
In every small detail
To be like Him.

4.
Give me a heart of faith
A hope in Thee
Give joy of salvation
In Jesus Christ
Give me a living soul
Give me a crown of glory
And when I shall awake
To be like Him.
