Thy Word Is A Lamp To My Feet - 8.7.8.7. with Ref.

1.
Thy word is a lamp to my feet
A light to my path always
To guide and to save me from sin
And show me the heav’nly way.
CHORUS
Thy word have I hid in my heart
That I might not sin against Thee
That I might not sin
That I might not sin
Thy word have I hid in my heart.

2.
Forever O Lord Thy word
Established and fixed on high
Thy faithfulness unto all men
Abideth forever nigh.

3.
At morning, at noon and at night
I ever will give Thee praise
For Thou art my portion, O Lord
And shall be thro’ all my days

4.
Thro’ Him whom Thy word hath foretold
The Saviour and Morning Star
Salvation and peace have been bro’t
To those who have strayed afar.
