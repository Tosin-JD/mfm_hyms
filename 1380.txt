Lift Him Up

1.
How to reach the masses, men of ev'ry birth.
For an answer Jesus gave the key:
“And I, if I be lifted up from the earth.
Will draw all men unto Me." 

CHORUS
Lift Him up, Lift Him up,
Still He speaks from eternal:
“And I, if I be lifted up from the earth,
Will draw all men unto Me.”

2.
Oh! the world is hungry for the Living Bread,
Lift the Savour up for them to see;
Trust Him, and do not doubt thewords that He said,
“I’ll draw all men unto Me.”

3.
Don’t exalt the preacher, don’t exalt the pew,
Preach the Gospel simple, full and free;
Prove Him and you will find that promise is true,
“I’ll draw all men unto Me.”

4.
Lift Him up by living as a Christian ought.
Let the world in you the Savour see;
Then men will gladly follow Him who
once taught,
“I’ll draw all men unto Me.”
