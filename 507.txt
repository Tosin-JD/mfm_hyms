Leigh - ,M.

1.
I know that my Redeemer lives;
Oh the sweet joy this sentence gives!
He lives, He lives, who once was dead;
He lives, my everlasting Head.

2.
He lives to bless me with His love,
And still He pleads for me above;
He lives to raise me from the grave,
And me eternally to save.

3.
He lives, my kind, wise, constant Friend;
Who still will keep me to the end;
He lives, and while He lives I'll sing,
Jesus, my Prophet, Priest, and King.

4.
He lives my mansion to prepare,
And He will bring me safely there;
He lives, all glory to His name,
Jesus, unchangeably the same.
