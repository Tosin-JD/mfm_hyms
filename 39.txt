Old 100th - L. M.

1.
Before Jehovah’s awful throne,
Ye nations, bow with sacred joy;
Know that the Lord is God alone:
He can create, and he destroy.

2.
His sovereign power, without our aid,
Made us of clay, and formed us men;
And, when like wandering sheep we strayed,
He brought us to his fold again.

3.
We’ll crowd thy gates with thankful songs,
High as the heavens our voices raise;
And earth, with her ten thousand tongues,
Shall fill thy courts with sounding praise.

4.
Wide as the world is thy command,
Vast as eternity thy love;
Firm as a rock thy truth shall stand,
When rolling years shall cease to move.

- Isaac Watts
