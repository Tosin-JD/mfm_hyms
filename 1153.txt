Wait, and Murmur Not

1.
O troubled heart, there is a home,
Beyond the reach of toil and care;
A home where changes never come:
Who would not fain be resting there?

CHORUS
O wait, meekly wait, and murmur not,
O wait, meekly wait, and murmur not,
O wait, O wait, O wait, and murmur not.

2.
Yet when bowed down beneath the load.
By heaven allowed, thine earthly lot;
Look up! thouâ€™ll reach that blest abode;
Wait, meekly wait, and murmur not.

3.
Toil on, nor deem, tho' sore it be,
One sigh unheard, one prayer forgot;
The day of rest will dawn for thee;
Wait, meekly wait, and murmur not.

- W. H. Ballamy
