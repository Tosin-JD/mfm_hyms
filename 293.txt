Franconia - S.M.

1.
I give myself to Thee,
My Saviour and my God,
To be Thine own for evermore.
The purchase of Thy blood.

2.
I give myself to Thee,
My Father and my Friend,
To walk in all Thy perfect way,
Until my life shall end.

3.
O help me to renounce
The hateful works of sin,
The empty vanities of life,
The flesh that strives within.

4.
O help me to believe
Thy living word of truth,
And take it as the perfect guide
Of my imperfect youth.

5.
O help me to obey
The law which Thou hast given,
And daily by Thy grace to tread
The pal* that leads to heaven.

6.
And ever more and more,
Lord, let Thy servant prove
The riches of redeeming grace,
The wonders of Thy love.

7.
Thus rooted in Thy love,
And steadfast in Thy faith,
Joyful through hope may I remain
Still faithful unto death.

8.
So having passed the waves
Of this worldâ€™6 troubled sea,
May I within Thy kingdom reign,
My Saviour God, with Thee.
