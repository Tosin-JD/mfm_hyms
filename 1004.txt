WITH MY SAVIOUR EVER NEAR TO GUIDE ME

1.
With my Saviour ever near to guide me,
I am safe, whatever may betide me;
From the storm and tempest He will hide me,
In the hollow of His hands.

CHORUS
In the hollow of His hand!
In the hollow of His hand!
I am safe whatever may betide me,
In the hollow of His hand!

2.
In His arms of love He doth enfold me;
Words of peace His voice divine hath told me;
I am safe, for God Himself doth hold me
In the hollow of His hand!

3.
He will guard my soul, and leave me never,
From His love no power on earth shall sever;
And I know Heâ€™ll keep me now and ever,
In the hollow of His hand!
