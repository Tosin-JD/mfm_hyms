Babylon’s streams - L.M.

1.
That day of wrath, that dreadful day,
When heaven and earth shall pass away,
What power shall be the sinner's stay?
How shall he meet that dreadful day?

2.
When, shrivelling like a parched scroll,
The flaming heavens together roll;
When louder yet, and yet more dread,
Swells the high trump that wakes the dead;

3.
O on that day, that wrathful day,
When man to judgement wakes from clay,
Be thou, O Christ, the sinner’s stay,
Though heaven and earth shall pass away.

- Sir Walter Scott
