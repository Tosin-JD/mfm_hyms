Arthur’s seat - 6 6.6.6.8.8.

1.
March on, O soul, with strength!
Like those strong men of old,
Who, ‘gainst enthroned wrong
Stood confident and bold;
Who, thrust in pris’n or cast to flame
Still made their glory in Thy name

2.
The sons of fathers we,
By whom our faith is taught
To fear no ill, to fight
The holy fight they fought;
Heroic warriors, ne’er from Christ,
By any lure or guile, enticed.

3.
March on, O soul, with strength,
As strong the battle rolls!
Gainst lies and lusts and wrongs,
Let courage rule our souls:
In keenest strife, Lord, may we stand,
Upheld and strengthened by Thy hand.

4.
Not long the conflict: soon
The holy war shall cease,
Faith’s warfare ended,
Won The home of endless peace!
Buck up! the victor’s crown at length!
March on, O soul, march on, with strength!

- George T. Coster
