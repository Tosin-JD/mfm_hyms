Ye Little Ones Keep Close To God - L.M.

1.
Ye little ones keep close to God
In trembling and humility
Let all knees bow down before Him,
Our Lord and Saviour and our Friend.

2.
O Saviour, let Thy great mercy
Fill us with gratitude to Thee
And in our pilgrimage on earth
May we receive more of Thy grace.

3.
O Saviour, may all evil thoughts
Be far away flung from our hearts,
And each day, give us Thy wisdom
To choose to walk the narrow way.

4.
In times of sickness and good health.
In times of plenty or in need,
And when the hour of death shall come
Deliver us with Thy great powâ€™r.
