Crowle - C.M.

1.
O thou in all thy might so far,
In all thy love so near,
Beyond the range of sun and star.
And yet beside us here:

2.
What heart can comprehend thy
name, Or searching find thee out?
Who art within, a quickening flame,
A presence round about.

3.
More dear than all the things I know
Is childlike faith to me,
That makes the darkest way I go
An open path to thee.

4.
Yet though I know thee but in part,
I ask not, Lord, for more;
Enough for me to know thou art,
To love thee, and adore.

- Frederick Lucian Hosmer
