Altogether Lovely

1.
Beautiful the fields beyond the river!
Glorious the thousands gathered there!
But who in heav’n, so full of grace and glory
Who with Him, our Saviour, can compare?

CHORUS
Oh, He is the chief among ten thousand!
Roll His praise in joyful waves along!
For “altogether, altogether lovely!”
Shall for ever be our happy song!

2.
Altogether, altogether lovely!
He is calling tenderly to thee;
My soul, why not accept His great salvation,
Offered now so rich, so full, so free?

3.
Altogether, altogether lovely!
Hear His voice how tender still the call:
“Come, come, ye weary ones and heavy laden,
Come to Me, and let your burdens
fall! your burdens fall!”

- G. F. Root.
