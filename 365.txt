Where He Leads I’ll Follow

1.
Sweet are the promises, Kind is the word,
Dearer far than any message man ever heard;
Pure was the mind of Christ,
Sinless I see;
He the great example is, and pattern for me.

CHORUS
Where He leads I’ll follow.
Follow all the way
Where He leads I’ll follow,
Follow Jesus ev’ry day.

2.
Sweet is the tender love Jesus hath shown,
Sweeter far than any love that mortals have known;
Kind to the erring one. Faithful is He;
He the great example is, and pattern for me.

3.
List to His loving words, “Come unto Me;”
Weary, heavy laden, there is sweet rest for thee;
Trust in His promises. Faithful and sure;
Lean upon the Saviour, and thy soul is secure.
