Azmon - C. M.

1.
I’m not ashamed to own my Lord,
Or to defend His cause,
Maintain the honour of His word,
The glory of His Cross.

2.
Jesus, my God! I know His name,
His name is all my trust;
Nor will He put my soul to shame,
Not let my hope be lost.

3.
Firm as His throne His promise
stands,
And He can well secure
What I’ve committed to His hands
Till the decisive hour.

4.
Then will He own my worthless name
Before His Father’s face,
And in the new Jerusalem
Appoint my soul a place.

- Isaac Watts
