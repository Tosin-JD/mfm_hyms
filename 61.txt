PRAIS TO GOD, IMMORTAL PRAISE


1.
Praise to God, immortal praise,
For the love that crowns our days;
Bounteous source of ev'ry joy,
Let Thy praise our tongues employ;
All to Thee, our God, we owe,
Source whence all our blessings flow.

2.
All the plenty summer pours;
Autumn's rich o’er-flowing stores;
Flocks that whiten all the plain;
Yellow sheaves of ripened grain:
Lord, for these our souls shall raise
Grateful vows and solemn praise.

3.
Peace, prosperity and health,
Private bliss, and public wealth,
Knowledge with its gladd’ning streams,
Pure religion's holier beams:
Lord, for these our souls shall raise
Grateful vows and solemn praise.

4.
As Thy prosp’ring hand hath blest,
May we give Thee of our best;
And by deeds of kindly love
For Thy mercies grateful prove;
Singing thus thro' all our days,
Praise to God, immortal praise.
