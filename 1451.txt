Hark, Hark, My Soul

1.
Hark, hark, my soul! Angelic songs are swelling
O’er earth's green fields and ocean’s wave beat shore;
How sweet the truth those blessed strains are telling
Of that new life when sin shall beno more!

CHORUS
Angels of Jesus,angels of light,
Singing to welcome the pilgrims of the night!

2.
Far, far away, like bells at evening pealing,
The voice of Jesus sounds o'er land and sea.
And laden soul by thousands meekly stealing,
Kind Shepherd, turn their weary steps to Thee.

3.
Onward we go, for still we hear them singing,
Come, weary souls, for Jesus bids you come;
And thro’ the dark, its echoes sweetly ringing,
The music of the gospel leads us home.

4.
Angels, sing on! Your faithful watches keeping;
Sing us sweet fragments of the songs above;
Till morning’s joy shall end the night of weeping,
And life’s long shadows break in cloudless love.
