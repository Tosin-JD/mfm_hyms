The light of the world is Jesus

1.
The whole world was lost in darkness of sin,
The light of the world is Jesus:
Like sunshine at noon day His glory shone in,
The light of the world is Jesus.

CHORUS
Come to the Light, 'tis shinning for thee;
Sweetly the Light has dawned upon me;
Once I was blind, but now I can see:
The Light of the world is Jesus

2.
No darkness have we who in Jesus abide,
The Light of the world is Jesus;
We walk in the Light when we
follow our Guide,
The Light of the world is Jesus.

3.
Ye dwellers in darkness with sin-blinded eyes,
The Light of the world is Jesus;
Go, wash, at His bidding, and light will arise,
The Light of the world is Jesus.

4.
No need of the sunlight in heaven we're told,
The Light of that world is Jesus;
The Lamb is the Light in the City of Gold,
The Light of that world is Jesus.
