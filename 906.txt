My Wonderful Lord

1.
I have found a deep peace that never had known
And a joy this world could not afford since
I yielded control of my body and soul
To my wonderful, wonderful Lord.

CHORUS
My wonderful Lord, my wonderful Lord,
By angels and seraphs in heaven adored!
I bow at Thy shrine, my Saviour divine,
My wonderful, wonderful Lord.

2.
I desire that my life shall be ordered by Thee,
That my will be in perfect accord With
Thine own sovâ€™reign will, Thy desires to fulfill,
My wonderful, wonderful Lord.

3.
All the talents I have, I have laid at Thy feet;
Thy approval shall be my reward.
Be my store great or small, I surrender it all
To my wonderful, wonderful Lord.

4.
Thou art fairer to me than the fairest of earth,
Thou omipotent, life-giving Word,
O Thou Ancient of Days, Thou art worthy all praise,
My wonderful, wonderful Lord.
