Tell it out

1.
Tell it out among the heathen that the Lord is King!
Tell it out' Tell it out!
Tell it out among the nations, bid them shout and sing!
Tell it out! Tell it out!
Tell it out with adoration that He shall increase,
That the mighty King of Glory is the
King of Peace;
Tell it out with jubilation, thoâ€™ the waves may roar,
That He sitteth on the water floods, our King for evermore!

CHORUS
Tell it out among the heathen that the Lord is King!
Tell it out! Tell it out!
Tell it out among the nations, bid them shout and sing!
Tell it out!

2.
Tell it out among the heathen that the Saviour reigns!
Tell it out! Tell it out!
Tell it out among the nations, bid them burst their chains!
Tell it out! Tell it out!
Tell it out among the weeping ones that Jesus lives;
Tell it out among the weary ones  what rest He gives;
Tell it out among the sinners that He came to save;
Tell it out among the dying that He triumph'd o'er the grave!

3.
Tell it out among the heathen, Jesus reigns above!
Tell it out! Tell it out!
Tell it out among the nations that He reigns in love!
Tell it out! Tell it out!
Tell it out among the high ways and the lanes at home;
Let it ring across the mountains and the ocean foam!
Like the sound of many waters let our glad shout be,
Till it echo and re-echo from the islands of the sea!
