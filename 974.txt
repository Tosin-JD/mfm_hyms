St Gertrude - 6.5.6.5.D. with Refrain


1.
Onward, Christian soldiers,
Marching as to war.
With the cross of Jesus Going on before!
Christ, the royal Master, Leads against the foe;
Forward into battle See His banners

2.
At the sign of triumph Satan’s host doeth flee;
On, then, Christian soldiers, On to victory!
Hell’s foundations quiver At the shout of praise;
Brothers, lift your voices. Loud your anthems raise!

3.
Like a mighty army Moves the Church of God;
Brothers, we are treading Where the saints have trod.
We are not divided, All one body we
One in hope and doctrine, One in charity.

4.
Onward, then, ye people, Join our happy throng;
Blend with ours your voices In the triumph song.
Glory, laud and honour Unto Christ the King
This thru countless ages Men and angels sing.
