1106
Maitland

1.
Must Jesus bear the cross alone,
And all the world go free?
No, there's a cross for ev’ry one,
And there’s a cross for me.

2.
The consecrated cross I’ll bear.
Till death shall set me free,
And then go home my crown to wear,
For there’s a crown for me.

3.
Upon the crystal pavement, down
At Jesus pierced feet,
Joyful, I'll cast my golden crown,
And His dear name repeat.

4.
Oh! precious cross! Oh! glorious crown!
Oh! resurection day!
Ye angels, from the stars come down,
And bear my soul away.

- Thomas Shepherd
