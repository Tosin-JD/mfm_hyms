Hankey 7.6.7.6.D. with Refrain

1.
I love to tell the story Of unseen things above.
Of Jesus and His glory. Of Jesus and His love.
I love to tell the story, Because Iknow 'tis true;
It satisfied my longing as nothing else can do.

CHORUS
I love to tell the story,
’Twill be my theme in glory
To tell the old, old story
Of Jesus and His love.

2.
I love to tell the story, ‘tis pleasant to repeat
What seems, each time I tell it,
More wonderfully sweet;
I love to tell the story, For some have never heard
The message of salvation From God’s own holy Word.

3.
I love to tell the story, for those who know it best
Seem hungering and thirsting to hear it like the rest;
And when in scenes of glory I sing the new, song.
Twill be the old, old story that I have loved so long.
