The Holy Ghost To Me Is Given

1.
The Holy Ghost to me is given
An earnest of my home in heaven;
Since He has taken full control,
I’ve Pentecost in my soul.

CHORUS
I’ve Pentecost in my soul
I’ve Pentecost in my soul
The Spirit has come for ever toabide;
I’ve Pentecost in my soul.

2.
He deigns to dwell-my heart within,
And quell the power of pardoned sin;
Though o’er my head dark clouds may roll,
I’ve Pentecost in my soul.

3.
I shout aloud with sacred joy.
His praise shall my powers employ;
His blessed name my tongue extol,
For Pentecost in my soul.

4.
And when I reach your world of bliss
A land more glorious far than this
I’ll sing while countless ages roll,
I’ve Pentecost in my soul.

5.
Then seek this gift without delay,
Receive the royal Guest today;
Yield all to His benign control.
Let Pentecost fill your soul.
