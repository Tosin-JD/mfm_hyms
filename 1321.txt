Christ For The World We Sing

1.
Christ for the world we sing;
The world to Christ we bring,
With loving zeal;
The poor and them that mourn.
The faint and over borne
Sin sick and sorrow worn.
Whom Christ doth heal.

2.
Christ for the world we sing;
The world to Christ we bring.
With fervent pray'r;
The wayward and the lost,
By restless passions tossed,
Redeemed at countless cost
From dark despair.

3.
Christ for the world we sing;
The world to Christ we bring,
With one accord,
With us the work to share,
With us reproach to dare,
With us the cross to bear.
For Christ our Lord.

- Samuel Wolcott
