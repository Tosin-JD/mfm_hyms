Mabledon - 8.7.8.7.3.3.7.

1.
Christmas for God's holy people
is a time of joy and peace:
so, all Christian men and
women,hymns and carols let us raise
to our God come to earth,
Son of Man, by human birth.

2.
Child of Mary, virgin mother,
peasant baby, yet our King,
cradled there among the oxen:
joyful carols now we sing
to our God come to earth,
Son of Man, by human birth.

3.
Angel armies sang in chorus
to our Christâ€™s nativity;
he who came to share our nature:
so we sing with gaiety come to earth.
Son of Man, by human birth.

4.
Shepherds hurried to the manger,
saw the babe of Bethlehem,
glorified the God in heaven:
now we join to sing with them
to our God come to earth,
Son of Man, by human birth.

5.
Infant lowly born in squalor,
prophet, king and great high priest.
Word of God to man descending:
still we sing, both great and least,
to our God come to earth.
Son of Man, by human birth.
