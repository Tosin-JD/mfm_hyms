I am Coming Home

1.
Jesus, I am coming home today,
For I have found there’s joy in Thee alone;
From the path of sin I turn away,
Now I am coming home.

CHORUS
Jesus, I am coming home today,
Never, nevermore from Thee to stray;
Lord, I now accept Thy precious promise,
I am coming home.

2.
Many years my heart has strayed from Thee,
And now repentant to Thy throne I come;
Jesus opened up the way for me. 
Now I am coming home.

3.
Oh, the misery my sin has caused me,
Naught but pain and sorrow I have known;
Now I seek Thy saving grace and many,
I am coming home.

4.
Fully trusting in Thy precious promise,
With no righteousness to call my own,
Pleading nothing but the blood of Jesus,
I am coming home.

5.
Now I seek the cross where Jesus died!
For all my sins His blood will still atone,
Flowing o’er till ev’ry stain is covered,
I am coming home.
