Benton Harbor - 8.7.8.7. with Refrain

1.
Christ has for sin atonement made
What a wonderful Saviour!
We are redeemed, the price is paid
What a wonderful Saviour!

CHORUS
What a wonderful
Saviour is Jesus, my Jesus!
What a wonderful
Saviour is Jesus, my Lord!

2.
I praise Him for the cleansing blood
What a wonderful Saviour!
That reconciled my soul to God
What a wonderful Saviour!

3.
He cleansed my heart from all its sin
What a wonderful Saviour!
And now He reigns and rules therein
What a wonderful Saviour!

4.
He gives me over coming powâ€™r
What a wonderful Saviour!
And triumph in each trying hour
What a wonderful Saviour!

- Elisha A. Hoffman
