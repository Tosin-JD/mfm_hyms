1.
I am so glad that our Father in Heav'n
Tells of His love in the Book He has giv’n,
Wonderful things in the Bible I see;
This is the dearest, that Jesus loves me

CHORUS
I am so glad that Jesus loves me,
Jesus loves me, Jesus loves me;
I am so glad that Jesus loves me,
Jesus loves even me.

2.
Tho’ I forget Him and wander away.
Still He doth love wherever I stray;
Back to His dear loving arms would I flee,
When I remember that Jesus loves me

3.
Oh, if there's only one song I can sing,
When in His beauty I see the great King,
This shall my song in eternity be:
“Oh, what a wonder that Jesus loves me.”

- Philip P. Bliss
