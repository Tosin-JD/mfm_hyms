Christ arose - 6.5.6.4. with Refrain

1.
Low in the grave He lay, Jesus my Saviour!
Waiting the coming day, Jesus my Lord!

CHORUS
Up from the grave He arose.
With a mighty triumph oâ€™er His foes;
He arose a Victor from the dark domain,
And He lives forever with His saintsto reign,
He arose! He arose! Hallelujah!
Christ arose!

2.
Vainly they watch His bed, Jesus my Saviour!
Vain they seal the dead, Jesus my Lord!

3.
Death cannot keep his prey, Jesus my Saviour!
He tore the bars away, Jesus my Lord!
