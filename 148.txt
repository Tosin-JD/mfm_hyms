St. George (Gauntlett) - S.M.

1.
This is the day of light:
Let there be light today;
O Dayspring, rise upon our night,
And chase its gloom away.

2.
This is the day of rest:
Our failing strength renew;
On weary brain and troubled breast
Shed Thou Thy freshening dew.

3.
This is the day of peace:
Thy peace our spirits fill:
Bid Thou the blasts of discord cease;
The waves of strife be still.

4.
This is the day of prayer:
Let earth to heaven draw near;
Lift up our hearts to seek Thee there;
Come down to meet us here.

5.
This is the first of days:
Send forth Thy quickening breath,
And wake dead souls to love and praise,
O Vanquisher of death.

- H. J. Gauntlett
