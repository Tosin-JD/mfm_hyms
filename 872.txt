I’ve a Saviour Kind and Tender

1.
I’ve a Saviour, kind and tender,
I’ve a Saviour full of grace,
And a smile of winning sweetness
Ever beams upon His face:
In my heart’s shrine of affection
He shall hold the highest place.

CHORUS
How I love Himl How I love Him!
Since for me He bled and died
How I love Him, Yes I love Him
More than all the world beside.

2.
For my sake He came from Heaven
To this world of sin and shame;
Bore my guilt, though He was
guiltless,And though blameless, took my blame:
Can I ever cease to love Him,
And His goodness to proclaim?

3.
Though I’ve often been unworthy,
He has constant been,and true;
Though I wronged Him, He forgave me
When I would my vows renew;
Though I spurned Him, He with kindness
My rebellious heart did Woo.

4.
I've a Saviour, kind and tender,
He would be your Saviour too;
Will you not accept the pardon
Which He freely offers you?
Take Him now as your Redeemer,
Earth has not a friend so true.
