Awake, My Soul, and With The Sun

1.
Awake, my soul, and with the sun
Thy daily stage of duty run;
Shake off dull sloth, and joyful rise,
To pay thy morning sacrifice.

2.
All praise to Thee, who safe has kept,
And hast refreshed me whilst I slept.
Grant, Lord, when I from death shall wake,
I may of endless life partake

3.
Lord, I my vows to Thee renew;
Disperse my sins as morning dew;
Guard my first springs of thought and will,
And with Thyself my spirit fill.

4.
Direct, control, suggest, this day,
All I design, or do, or say,
That all my powers, with all their might.
In Thy sole glory may unite.

5.
Redeem Thy misspent moments past,
And live this day as if thy last;
Thy talents to improve take care;
For the great day thyself prepare.

6.
Let all thy, converse be sincere,
Thy conscience as the noonday clear;
For God's all-seeing eye surveys
Thy secret thoughts, thy words and
ways.

7.
By influence of the light Divine
Let thy own light to others shine;
Reflect all Heaven's propitious rays
In ardent love and cheerful praise.
