The harbour bells - D.L.M.

1.
Our life is like a stormy sea
Swept by the gales of sin and grief:
While on the windward and the lee
Hang heavy clouds of unbelief.
But o’er the deep a call we hear,
Like harbour bell’s inviting voice;
It tells the lost that hope is near,
And bids the trembling soul rejoice.

CHORUS
'This way this way, O heart opprest,
So long by storm and tempest driv’n;
This way, this way lo! Here is rest,
“Rings out the harbour bell of heaven.

2.
Oh, let us now the call obey,
And steer our bark for yonder shore;
Where still that voice directs the way,
In pleading tones for ever more.
A thousand life wrecks strew the sea;
They’re going down at ev’ry swell:
“Come unto Me! Come unto Me!
“Rings out th' assuring harbour bell.

3.
O tempted one, lookup, be strong!
The promise of the Lord is sure,-
That they shall sing the victor’s song,
Who faithful to the end endure.
God's Holy Spirit comes to thee,
Of His abiding love to tell,
To blissful port, o’er stormy sea,
Calls heaven’s inviting harbour bell.

4.
Come, gracious Lord, and in Thy love
Conduct us o'er life’s stormy wave;
Oh, guide us to the home above,
The blissful home beyond the grave;
There, safe from rock, and storm, and flood,
Our song of praise shall never cease,
To Him who bought us with His blood,
And brought us to the port of peace.
