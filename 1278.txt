Happiness Is the Lord

1.
Happiness is to know the Saviour,
Living a life within His favor,
Having a change in my behaviour,
Happiness is the Lord;

2.
Happiness is a new creation,
“Jesus and me” in close relation,
Having a part in His salvation,
Happiness is the Lord.
Real joy is mine, 
no matter if tear drops start;
I’ve found the secret,
It’s Jesus in my heart!

3.
Happiness is to be forgiven,
Living a life that’s worth the livin’
Taking a trip that leads to heaven,
Happiness is the Lord,
Happiness is the Lord,
Happiness is the Lord!
