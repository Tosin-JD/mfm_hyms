O Crown Of Rejoicing

1.
O crown of rejoicing that's waiting for me,
When finished my course, and when Jesus I see,
And when from my Lord comes the sweet sounding word,
Receive faithful servant, the joy of the Lord.

CHORUS
O crown of rejoicing, O wonderful song;
O joy everlasting, O glorified throng
O beautiful home, my home can it be?
O glory reserved for me

2.
O wonderful song that in glory I’ll sing,
To Him who redeemed me to Jesus my King;
All glory and honour to Him shall be giv’n,
And praises unceasing forever in heav'n.

3.
O joy everlasting when heaven is won.
Forever in glory to shine as the sun;
No sorrow nor sighing these all flee away.
No night there, no shadows tis one endless flay.

4.
O wonderful name which the glorified bear.
The new name which Jesus bestows on us there;
To him that o’er cometh ‘twill only be giv’n.
Blest sign of approval, our welcome to heav'n.
