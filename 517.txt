Metzler - 8.6.8.6.C.M.

1.
Jesus our hope, our heart’s desire,
your work of grace we sing:
you are the saviour of the world,
its maker and its king.

2.
How vast the mercy and the grace,
how great the love must be,
which led you to a cruel death
to set your people free!

3.
But now the chains of death are burst,
the ransom has been paid,
and you are at your Father’s side
in glorious robes arrayed.

4.
All praise to you, triumphant Lord
ascended high in heaven
to God, the Father, Spirit, Son,
be praise and glory given!
