Where There Are No Years

1.
In this world there are burdens we must bear
And our eyes are made wet and
Dim with tears
There's no grief neither sorrow over there
In that land where there are no
Days nor years.

CHORUS.
In that land where there are no
Days nor years
Neither sorrow nor anguish or tears
We shall dwell there in peace and
Our joys ne'er shall cease
In that land where there are no
Days nor years.

2.
Tho' we toil oft our labour seems in vain
We have faith tho' no fruit our vision cheers
but the Lord will all mystery make plain
In that land where there are no
Days nor years.

3.
so we smile as we labour day by day
And forget all our sorrows, griefs and fears
For when all earthly things have passed away
We shall dwell where there are no
Days nor years.
