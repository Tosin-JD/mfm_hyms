What love

1.
There’s a love beyond all human comprehension,
There’s a love that satisfies the yearning heart;
And to share this love with us was God’s intention
When He made this world and formed us at the start.

CHORUS
What love, what matchless grace.
What love, He took my place;
For a world so full of sin He died on Calv’ry,
Paid a price of blood for me and now I’m free.

2.
Jesus gave a call that all will have to reckon,
He has opened wide His arms to all who will;
If we choose His love alone tho’ Satan beckon,
Then the promise of His love He will fulfil.

3.
When the Bridegroom comes I’m going to a wedding,
That will make us one with Christ, God's only Son:
All the angels will be there and they’ll be singing
Songs of love that made God give His only Son.

4.
They will come from ev’ry tribe and ev’ry nation,
For the love of God has placed no boundary;
We will be made one in final consummation,
Chosen for His bride to be eternally.
