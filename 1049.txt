CHORUS
Tell it around, let it abound
There’s life in the risen Lord.

2.
All by nature are doomed to die,
So saith the Holy Word;
Welcome therefore the joyful cry,
There’s life in the risen Lord.
Welcome news of gladness
Antidote of sadness.

3.
Saint, apostles and prophets, all
Published with one accord,
This deliverance from the fall
This life in the risen Lord
Glory be to Jesus,
Who from bondage frees us.

4.
0 Pardon, power and perfect peace
The words of this life afford,
Never then let the tidings cease,
Of life in the risen Lord.
Open wide the portal,
Unto every mortal.
