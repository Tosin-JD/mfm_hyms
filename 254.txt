254
Come, for all things are ready - P.M.

1.
Come, for all things are ready!
'Tis a banquet of love;
Here’s a free invitation
From the Master above:
It is written in crimson,
Drawn from Calvary’s flood,
From the wonderful fountain
Of the soul cleansing blood.

CHORUS
Oh, what fullness in Jesus!
Oh, what gladness to know,
Tho’ our sins be as scarlet,
He'll make them as snow.

2.
Come, for all things are ready!
Heaven’s bounty is spread;
Take the cup of salvation,
Take the life giving bread:
Come, tho’ poor and unworthy;
Come, tho’ sinful and weak
Tis the hungry and thirsty
Whom the Master doth seek.

3.
Come, for all things are ready!
Here’s a robe, snowy white,
Fairer far than the raiment
Of the angels of light:
For the beauty of Jesus
Will thy covering be;
Only ask for this garment,
Twill be given to thee.
