1.
A life of overcoming,
A life of ceaseless praise,
Be this thy blessed portion
Throughout the coming days.
The victory was purchased
On Calv’ry cross for thee,
Sin shall not have dominion,
The Son hath made thee free.

2.
And would'st thou know the secret
Of constant victory?
Let in the Over Comer,
And He will conquer thee?
Thy broker spirit taken
In sweet captivity.
Shall glory in H i triumph
And share His victory.

3.
Though all the path before thee
The host of darkness fill,
Look to thy Father’s promise.
And claim the victory still.
Faith sees the heavenly legions.
Where doubt sees naught but foes,
And through the very conflict
Her life the stronger grows.

4.
More stern will grow the conflict
As nears our King’s return,
And they alone can face it
Who this great lesson learn:
That from them God asks nothing
But to unlatch the door
Admitting Him who through them,
Will conquer evermore.
