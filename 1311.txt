My Great physician - 7.6.

1.
Thou art my great “Physician."
My Saviour and my All;
I look to Thee for blessing,
And on Thy mercy call.
With tend'rest care Thou watchest
Beside the couch of pain,
And givest health and healing,
When human help is vain;

2.
When in the midnight watches,
With anxious care oppress'd,
I often hear Thee whisper,
"Come unto Me and rest."
Thou carest for the weary,
Dost mark the sparrow's fall:
Then surely I can trust Thee,
Thou art my “All in All";

3.
Thou art my “Tower of Refuge,”
My "Strength" upon the way;
My “Hope” of endless glory.
When ends life's fleeting day!
Thou art the only “Healer ”
For body, mind, and soul,
And when all others fall me,
Thy touch can make me whole.

4.
Thou art my “Resurrection”
To life that never dies.
Where Thou art now preparing
A mansion in the skies.
Then hasten Thine appearing,
To take Thy people home,
Where sickness, pain, and sorrow,
Shall never, never come.

- F. J. Crosby
