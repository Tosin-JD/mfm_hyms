Firm are the Promises Standing

1.
Firm are the promises standing,
Nor can they ever foil.
Sealed with the blood of our Jesus,
They must, they shall avail!

CHORUS
Heaven and earth may perish.
Mountain and hill may vanish;
Yet stands the Word we cherish.
Ever to faith made sure.

2.
Follow in Abraham’s footsteps.
Turn to the heav’ns your eyes;
Counting the stars without number.
Your faith, your hope will rise.

3.
Trust, though the darkness be foiling
Soon will the sun arise
Shedding bright beams in the morning
O’er earth and sea and skies.

4.
Trust, though the world may beset you;
Faith has no dread or fear
Lo in the fiery furnace
The Son of God draws near!

5.
Trust, though your friends disappoint you.
Leaving you one by one;
Jesus, true Friend, will stand by you
Till pilgrim days are done.

6.
Trust Him, whatever betide you;
Soon in the mansions bright
All will be clear as the noonday:
Faith turned to glorious sight!
