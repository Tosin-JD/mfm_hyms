Herongate - L.M.

1.
O thou through suffering perfect made,
On whom the bitter cross was laid.
In hours of sickness, grief and pain.
No sufferer turns to Thee in vain.

2.
Oh loving Saviour. Thou canst cure
The pains and woes Thou didstendure;
For all who need, Physician great.
Thy healing balm we supplicate.

3.
But O, far more, let each keen pain
And hour of woe be heavenly gain.
Each stroke of Thy chastising rod
Bring back the wanderer nearer God.

4.
O heal the bruised heart within;
O save our souls all sick with sin;
Give life and health in bounteous store
That we may praise Thee evermore.

- W. Walsham
