Passfield - 5.5.7.D.

1.
Born of the water,
born of the Spirit
sons of the wind and the fire;
sealed with his promise,
we shall inherit
more than the most we desire.

2.
One through redemption,
one with the Father
children of grace and of heaven;
joyfully sharing
faith with each other,
sinners whose sins are forgiven.

3.
Glory, all glory,
glory to Jesus
die we in him and we live!
friends for his service,
heirs to the treasures
God, and God only, can give.

- Michael Perry
