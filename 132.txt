EUDOXIA - 6.5.6.5.

1.
Now the day is over,
Night is drawing nigh;
Shadows of the evening
Steal across the sky.

2.
Jesus, give the weary
Calm and sweet repose;
With Thy tendâ€™rest blessing
May our eyelids close.

3.
Grant to little children
Visions bright of Thee;
Guard the sailors tossing
On the deep blue sea.

4.
Thru the long night watches
May Thine angels spread
Their white wings above me,
Watching round my bed.

5.
When the morning wakens,
Then may I arise
Pure and fresh and sinless
In Thy holy eyes.

- Sabine Baring-Gould
