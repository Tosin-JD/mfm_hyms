Lydia -8.6.8.6.

1.
Jesus! the name high over all
in hell or earth or sky;
angels and men before it f all
and devils fear and fly.

2.
Jesus! the name to sinners dear,
the name to sinners given;
it scatters all their guilty fear,
it turns their hells to heaven.

3.
Jesus the prisoner’s fetters breaks
and bruises Satan's head;
power into strengthless souls he speaks
and life into the dead.

4.
O that the world might taste and see
the riches of his grace!
the arms of love that welcome me
would all mankind embrace.

5.
His righteousness alone I show,
his saving grace proclaim;
this is my work on earth below,
to cry 'Behold the Lamb!'

6.
Happy if with my final breath
I may but gasp his name,
preach him to all, and cry in death,
‘Christ Jesus is the Lamb!'

- C. Wesley
