WE NEVER NEED TO BE VANQUISHED - 7.6.7.6.D.

1.
We never need be vanquished,
We never need give in,
Though waging war with Satan,
And compassed round by sin.
Temptations will beset us.
Allurements oft assail,
But in the name of Jesus,
We shall, we must prevail.

CHORUS
Victory in Jesus' name,
Victory our hearts proclaim,
Victory, glorious victory.

2.
He leads us in triumph,
An overcoming band,
While vict'ry crowns His progress
“For none can stay His hand.”
Our eyes are on our Leader,
His presence is our might;
He arms us for the conflict,
And trains our hands to fight.

3.
God wills not that His people
By sin enthralled should be,
But their lives henceforward
Be lives of victory;
And so at our disposal,
He places all His power,
That we from its resources
May draw in danger’s hour.

4.
Herein is hid the secret
Of an all-glorious life,
Whereby we conquer Satan,
And rise above sin’s strife.
Abiding in the Saviour,
Self prostrate in the dust.
We live to do His bidding,
In glad perpetual trust.

5.
We in ourselves are nothing,
A small and feeble host,
Nor have aught of prowess
Wherewith to make our boast,
Our stronghold is Christ Jesus,
His grace alone we plead,
His name our shield and banner,
Himself just all we need.
