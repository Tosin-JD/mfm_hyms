Toss’d With Rough Winds, And Faint With Fear-8.6.8.6.

1.
Toss’d with rough winds, and faint with fear,
Above the tempest, soft and clear,
What still small accents greet mine ear?
‘Tis I; be not afraid.

2.
‘Tis I, who washed thy spirit white;
Tis I, who gave thy blind eyes sight;
Tis I, thy Lord, thy life, thy light;
Tis I, be not afraid.

3.
These raging winds this surging sea,
Have spent their deadly force on Me;
They bear no breath of wrath to thee;
Tis I; be not afraid.

4.
This bitter cup, I drank it first;
To thee it is no draught accurst;
The hand that gives it thee is pierced:
Tis I, be not afraid

5.
When on the other side thy feet
Shall rest mid thousand thy head,
My blessing is around thee shed:
Tis I, be not afraid.

6.
When on the other side thy feet
Shall rest mid thousand welcomes sweet,
On well-known voice thy heart shall greet,
‘Tis I, be not afraid.
