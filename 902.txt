A Passion for Souls

1.
Give me a passion for souls dear Lord.
A passion to save the lost;
O that Thy love were by all adored,
And welcomed at any cost.

CHORUS
Jesus, I long, I long to be winning
Men who are lost, and constantly sinning;
O may this hour be one of beginning
The story of pardon to tell.

2.
Though there are dangers untold and stem
Confronting me in the way.
Willingly still would I go,
nor turn, But trust Thee for grace each day.

3.
How shall this passion for souls be mine?
Lord, make Thou the answer clear,
Help me throw out the old Lifeline
To those who are struggling near.
