Killibegs - 8.8.8.8.

1.
Now let us from this table rise
renewed in body, mind and soul;
with Christ we die and live again,
his selfless love has made us whole.

2.
With minds alert, upheld by grace,
to spread the word in speech and
deed,we follow in the steps of Christ,
at one with man in hope and need.

3.
To fill each human house with love,
it is the sacrament of care;
the work that Christ began to do
we humbly pledge ourselves to share

4 Then give us courage, Father God
to choose again the pilgrim way,
and help us to accept with joy
the challenge of tomorrow’s day!
