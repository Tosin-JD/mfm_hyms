Austrian Hymn -8.7.8.7.D.

1.
Praise the Lord! ye heav'ns, adore Him;
Praise Him angels in the height;
Sun and moon, rejoice before Him;
Praise Him, all ye stars of light.
Praise the Lord! For He hath spoken;
Worlds His mighty voice obeyed;
Laws which never shall be broken
For their guidance He hath made.

2.
Praise the Lord! for He is glorious;
Never shall His promise fail;
God hath made His saints victorious;
Sin and death shall not prevail.
Praise the God of our salvation!
Hosts on high, His pow’r proclaim;
Heav’n and earth and all creation,
Laud and magnify His name.

3.
Worship, honour, glory, blessing,
Lord, we offer unto Thee;
Young and old, Thy praise expressing,
In glad homage bend the knee.
All the saints in heav'n adore Thee;
We would bow before Thy throne:
As Thine angels serve before Thee,
So on earth Thy will be done.
