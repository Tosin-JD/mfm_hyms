Lord Jesus, Thou Thy Church Hast Graced - 6.8.8.8.8.8.

1.
Lord Jesus, Thou Thy Church hast graced
With gifts supernal and divine,
Gift of Thy Spirit, pure and chaste
With heavenly lustre here to shine.
Ascending to Thy Father’s throne,
Thou hast bestowal! them on thine own.

2.
In Thee, our living head, are stored
Treasures of wisdom, light and love;
On us, Thy member, Thou hast poured
This wealth of blessing from above.
Oh, may we prove, this very hour,
The nine-fold splendour of Thy power!

3.
Speak, Lord! By word of Wisdom pure,
Thy will reveal Thy mind impart;
By word of knowledge, swift and sure
Illume, instruct, and guide each heart
So shall we trace Thy way divine,
Line upon line, in clear design,

4.
Thy mighty faith on us bestow,
Beyond our measure or our thought;
Let gifts of healing from Thee flow,
And wonders in Thy name be wrought.
Make bare Thine arm, confirm Thy word,
That all may own Thee Christ and Lord!

5.
Through our lip! We would aspire
To speak the praises of Thy love,
Gifted with pure prophetic fire
And holy unction from above;
Whilst, through Thy searching Spirit taught
The secret springs of life and thought

6.
With tongues of men or seraph strain,
Speak, forth Thy word in praise in prayer;
Then make each heaven-sent message plain,
That we thy glories may declare
Grace every gift with love's high theme:
Yea, reign o’er all, O Love supreme!
