Luther - 8.7.8.7.8.8.7.

1.
Sing praise to God who reigns above
The God of all creation,
The God of power, the God of love,
The God of our salvation;
With healing balm my soul he .ills,
And every faithless murmur stills:
To God all praise and glory.

2.
The Lord is never far away,
But, through all grief distressing,
An ever-present help and stay,
Our peace and joy and blessing;
As with a motherâ€™s tender hand,
he leads his own, his chosen band;
To God all praise and glory.

3.
Thus all my gladsome way along
I sang aloud thy praises,
That men may hear the grateful song
My voice unwearied raises.
Be joyful in the Lord, my heart;
Both soul and body bear your part:
To God all praise and glory.

- J. J. Schutz
