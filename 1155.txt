St. Mary Magdalene - 6.5.6.5.D.

1.
In the hour of trial,
Jesus, pray for me,
Lest by base denial
I depart from Thee;
When Thou seest me waver,
With a look recall,
Nor for fear or favour
Suffer me to fall.

2.
With its witching pleasures
Would this vain world charm.
Or its sordid treasure
Spread to work me harm.
Bring to my remembrance
Sad Gethsemane,
Or, in darker semblance,
Cross-crowned Calvary.

3.
If with sore affliction
Thou in love chastise,
Pour Thy benediction
On the sacrifice;
Then, upon Thine altar
Freely offered up.
Though the flesh may falter.
Faith shall drink the cup.

4.
When in dust and ashes'
To the grave I sink.
While heaven’s glory flashes
O’er the shelving brink,
On Thy truth relying
Through that mortal strife,
Lord, receive me, dying,
To eternal life.

- James Montgomery
