36
We’re Marching to Zion

1.
Come, ye that love the Lord,
And let your joys be known;
Join in a song with sweet accord,
Join in a song with sweet accord,
And thus surround the throne.
And thus surround the throne.

CHORUS
We’re marching to Zion,
Beautiful, beautiful, Zion:
We’re marching upward to Zion,
The beautiful city of God

2.
Let those refuse to sing
Who never knew our God:
But children of the heav’nly King,
But children of the heav'nly King
Shall speak their joys abroad,

3.
The hill of Zion yields
A thousand sacred sweets;
Before we reach the heav’nly fields,
Before we reach the heav’nly fields,
Or walk the golden streets,
Or walk the golden streets.

4.
Then let our songs abound,
And ev'ry tear be dry;
We’re marching thro’ Immanuel’s ground,
We’re marching thro’ Immanuel’s ground
To fairer worlds on high,
To fairer worlds on high.

- Isaac Watts
