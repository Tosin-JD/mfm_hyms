I Strive To Walk The Narrow Way - 8.8.8.6. with Ref.

1.
I strive to walk the narrow way,
To live near Jesus every day;
To Him each trying hour I pray
For saving keeping grace.

CHORUS
O what wonderful grace,
0 what wonderful grace,
For my every need, see,
There's grace enough for me.

2.
His voice recalls my erring soul,
And yielding all to His control,
0 feel His glory, oâ€™er me roll
The glory of His grace.

3.
I seek my Lord on bended knee,
His saving grace my only plea,
And then through tear-dimmed eyes I see,
The glory of His face.
