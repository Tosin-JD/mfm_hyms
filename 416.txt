Revive us again -11.11. with Refrain

1.
We praise Thee, 0 God,
for the Son of Thy love,
For Jesus who died and
is now gone above.

CHORUS
Hallelujah, Thine the glory!
Hallelujah, Amen!
Hallelujah, Thine the glory!
Revive us again.

2.
We praise Thee, O God,
for Thy Spirit of light,
Who has shown us our Saviour
and scattered our night.

3.
All glory and praise
to the Lamb that was slain,
Who has borne all our sins and
has cleansed evâ€™ry stain.

4.
Revive us again;
fill each heart with Thy love;
May each soul be rekindled
with fire from above.
