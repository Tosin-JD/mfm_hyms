Christ For The Whole Wide World

1.
Christ for the whole wide world!
Our task has ju§t begun.
For millions wait in every land
The message of God's Son.
Shall they be left in sin,
To die without His word,
Without the Saviour Jesus Christ,
Because they never heard?

CHORUS
We will give, we will pray,
We will witness every day,
That the millions of the whole wide world
May know our Saviour's love.

2.
Christ for the whole wide world!
His message must be sent
To millions dying in their sin
T.o call them to repent.
Christ Jesus died to save,
But they can never know
Until we bring our gifts of love
And bid His heralds go!

3.
Christ for the whole wide world!
His heralds will proclaim
Salvation for men everywhere
In Jesus’ blessed name.
And we who cannot go
To bear His tidings tar
Will pray for those who take the
Word and witness where we are.
