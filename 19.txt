Geneva - 8.5.8.5.

1.
God, who touchest earth with beauty,
Make me lovely too;
With Thy Spirit recreate me,
Make my heart anew.

2.
Like Thy springs and running waters,
Make me crystal pure,
Like Thy rocks of towering grandeur
Make me strong and sure.

3.
Like Thy shining waves in sunlight,
Make me glad and free;
Like the straightness of the pine trees,
Let me upright be.

4.
Like the arching of the heavens,
Lift my thoughts above;
Turn my dreams to noble action,
Ministries of love.

5.
God, who touchest earth with beauty,
Make me lovely too;
Keep me ever, by Thy Spirit,
Pure and strong and true.

- Mary S. Edgar
