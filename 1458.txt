1458
Holy, Holy, is What The Angels Sing

1.
There is singing up in heaven
such as we have never known
Where the angels sing the praises
of the Lamb upon the throne
Their sweet harps are ever tuneful
and their voices always clear
Oh, that we might be more like them
while we serve the Master here.

CHORUS
Holy, holy, is what the angels sing.
And I expect to help them
make the courts of heaven ring;
But when I sing redemption's story
they will fold their wings,
For angels never felt the joys
that our salvation brings.

2.
But i hear another anthem,
blending voices clear and strong
"Unto him who hath redeem'd us
and hath brought us," is the song
We have come thro' tribulations
to this land so fair and bright
In the fountain freely flowing
he hath made our garments white.

3.
Then the angels stand and listen,
for they cannot join that song
Like the sound of many waters,
by that happy, blood washâ€™d throng
For they sing about great trials,
battles fought and vict'ries won.
And they praise their great Redeemer
who hath said to them, "well done"

4.
So, although I'm not an angel,
yet I know that over there
I will join a blessed chorus
that the angels cannot share
I will sing about my Saviour
who upon dark Calvary
Freely pardon'd my transgressions,
died to set a sinner free.
