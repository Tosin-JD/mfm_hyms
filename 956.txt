On for Jesus!

1.
On for Jesus! steady be your arm and brave;
Onward, onward, take the shield and sword;
On for Jesus! standard of your Captain wave,
Pressing on ward, trusting in His word.

CHORUS
Marching, marching on,
We're marching onward still for Jesus;
Marching, marching on,
Beneath the banner of the free;

2.
On for Jesus! tiresome tho’ the conflict be,
Tho' the hosts of sin are pressing hard;
On for Jesus! striving for the victory,
Endless life will soon be your reward.

3.
On for Jesus! till the sound of strife is o’er!
When the great Commander calls for thee,
Thou shalt wear a crown of life forever more,
And with Jesus reign eternally.
