HE LIVES ON HIGH


1.
Christ the Saviour came from heaven's glory,
To redeem the lost from sin and shame;
On His brow He wore the thorn crown glory,
And upon Calvary He took my blame.

CHORUS
He lives on high, He lives on high,
Triumphant over sin and all its stain;
He lives on high, He lives on high,
Some day He’s coming again.

2.
He arose from death and all its sorrow,
To dwell in that land of joy and love;
He is coming back some gladtomorrow,
And He’ll take all His children home above.

3.
Weary soul, to Jesus come confessing,
Redemption from sin He offers thee;
Look to Jesus and receive a blessing,
There is life, there is joy and victory.
