Standing At The portal, Of The Op’ning Year -11.11.11.11.

1.
Standing at the portal, of the op’ning year,
Words of comfort meet us, hushing ev’ry fear.
Spoken through the silence, by our Father’s voice.
Tender, strong and faithful, making us rejoice.

CHORUS
Onward, then and fear not, children of the day!
For His Word shall never, never

2.
I, the Lord, am with thee, be thou not afraid!
I will help and strengthen, be thou not dismayed!
Yea, I will uphold thee, with My own right hand;
Thou art called and chosen, in My sight to stand.

3.
For the year before us, O what rich supplies!
For the poor and needy, living streams shall rise;
For the sad and sinful, shall His grace abound,
For the faint and feeble, perfect strength be found.

4.
He will never fail us, He will notforsake;
His eternal covenant, He will never break!
Resting on His promise, what have we to fear?
God is all sufficient, for the coming year.
