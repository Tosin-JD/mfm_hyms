Happy - 6.4.6.4.6.7.6.4.

1.
There is a happy land, Far, far away,
Where saints in glory stand, Bright, bright as day:
O how they sweetly sing, ‘Worthy is our Saviour King!’
Loud let His praises ring, Praise, praise for aye.

2.
Come to this happy land, Come, come away;
Why will ye doubting stand? Why still delay.
O we shall happy be When, from sin and sorrow free,
Lord, we shall live with Thee, Blest, blest for aye.

3.
Bright in that happy land Beams ev’ry eye:
Kept by a Father’s hand, Love cannot die:
On then to glory run; Be a crown and kingdom won;
And, bright above the sun, Reign, reign for aye.

- Andrew Young
