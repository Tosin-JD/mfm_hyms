Weary Wanderer - 8.7.8.7.

1.
Weary wandâ€™rer, stop and listen,
Happy news we bring to thee;
Jesus has prepared banquet;
Come, and welcome thou shalt be.

CHORUS
Make no longer vain excuses,
Jesus calls, and calls thee now;
Come, for ev'rything is ready;
Weary soul, why waitest thou?

2.
Are thy sins a heavy burden?
Come to God, confess them now;
He is willing to forgive thee;
Ask, receive, why waitest thou?

3.
On the loving arm of Jesus
Wouldst thou lean, and trust Him now?
Let Him cleanse thee at the fountain;
Come at once! why waitest thou?

4.
See the beauteous wedding garment;
In his hands He holds it now:
Haste, oh haste, there to the banquet:
Enter in! why waitest thou?
