Silchester - S.M.

1.
Not all the blood of beasts,
On Jewish altars slain,
Or wash away the stain.

2.
But Christ the heavenly Lamb,
Takes all our sins away;
A sacrifice of nobler name
And richer blood than they.

3.
My faith would lay her hand
On that dear head of Thine,
While like a penitent I stand.
And there confess my sin.

4.
My soul looks back to see
The burdens Thou didst bear,
When hanging on the cursed tree,
And knows her guilt was there.

5.
Believing, we rejoice
To see the curse remove:
We bless the Lamb with cheerful voice
And sing His bleeding love?

- Isaac Watts
