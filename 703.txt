Give Me The Faith Which Can Remove-8.8.8.D.

1.
Give me the faith which can remove
And sink the mountain to a plain,
Give me the child-like praying love
Which longs to build Thy house again;
Thy love let it my heart oâ€™er-power,
And all my simple soul devour.

2.
I want an even strong desire,
I want a calmly fervent zeal,
To save poor souls out of the fire,
To snatch them from the verge of hell.
And turn them to a pardoning God.
And quench the brands in Jesus' blood.

3.
I would the precious time redeem,
And longer live for this alone,
To spend, and to be spent, for them
Who have not yet my Saviourknown;
Fully on these my mission prove,
And only breathe, to breathe Thy Love.

4.
My talents gifts, and graces, Lord,
Into Thy blessed hands receive;
And let me live to preach Thy word,
And let me to Thy glory live;
My every sacred moment spend
In publishing the sinner's Friend.

5.
Enlarge, inflame, and fill my heart
W th boundless charity divine!
So shall I all my strength exert,
And love them with a zeal like Thine;
And lead them to Thy open side,
The sheep for whom their Shepherd died.
