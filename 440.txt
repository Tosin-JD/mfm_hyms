Blessed Be The Fountain

1.
Blessed be the Fountain of blood.
To a world of sinners reveal'd;
Blessed be the dear Son of God,
Only by His stripes are we heal’d:
Tho’ I’ve wander’d far from His fold.
Bringing to my heart pain and woe.
Wash me in the blood of the Lamb,
And I shall be whiter than snow.

CHORUS
Whiter than the snow
Whiter than the snow,
Wash me in the blood of the Lamb,
And I shall be whiter than snow.

2.
Thorny was the crown that He wore,
And the cross His body o’er came;
Grievous were the sorrows He bore,
But He suffer'd thus not in vain:
May I to that Fountain be led,
Made to cleanse my sins here below;
Wash me in the blood that He shed,
And I shall be whiter than snow.

3.
Father, I have wander’d from Thee,
Often has my heart gone astray;
Crimson do my sins seem to me:
Water can not wash them away;
Jesus, to that Fountain of Thine,
Leaning on Thy promise I go,
Cleanse me by Thy washing divine.
And I shall be whiter than snow.
