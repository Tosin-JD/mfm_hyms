BE THOU MY GUARDIAN AND MY GUIDE

1.
Be thou my guardian and my guide,
And hear me when I call;
Let not my slippery footsteps slide,
And hold me lest I fall.

2.
The world, the flesh, and Satan dwell
Around the path I tread;
O save me from the snares of hell,
Thou quickener of the dead.

3.
And if I tempted am to sin,
And outward things are strong,
Do thou, O Lord, Keep watch within,
And save my soul from wrong.

4.
Still let me ever watch and pray,
And feel that I am frail;
That if the tempter cross my way.
Vet he may not prevail.
