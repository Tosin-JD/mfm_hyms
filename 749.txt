O Loving Shepherd, Care For Us - C.M.

1.
O loving Shepherd, care for us
In these perilous time
Give unto all Thy disciple.
The power to watch and pray.

2.
When our trials persist, O Lord
And afflictions increase,
Grant that our hearts rely on thee,
In long prevailing prayers.

3.
The spirit of supplication
In faith, give Thou to us
Until we shall behold Thy face,
And know Thy mighty name.

4.
Until we are in communication,
And sweetest fellowship,
Let this be the heartâ€™s cry of all,
We will not let Thee go.

5.
I will not let Thee go except
Thou tells thy name to me,
Oh, bless me with thy salvation
And let me be like Thee.

6.
O, let me clearly see Thy face
Up there in heaven above,
Where faith will be transformed to sight,
And prayer becomes our praise.
