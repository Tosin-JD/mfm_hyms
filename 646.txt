Hold To God’s Unchanging Hand

1.
Time is filled with swift transition
Naught of earth unmoved can stand
Build your hopes on things eternal,
Hold to God's unchanging hand.

CHORUS
Hold to (Sod's unchanging hand!
Hold to God’s unchanging hand!
Build your hopes on things eternal,
Hold to God’s unchanging hand.

2.
Trust in Him who will not leave you,
Whatsoever years may bring.
If by earthly friends forsaken,
Still more closely to Him cling.

3.
When your journey is completed.
If to God you have been true,
Fair and bright the home in glory
Your enraptured soul will view.
