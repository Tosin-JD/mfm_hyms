Tryggare Kan Ingen Vara - L.M.

1.
Children of the heav'nly Father
Safely in His bosom gather;
Nestling bird nor star in heaven
Such a refuge was given

2.
God His own doth tend and
nourish,
In His holy courts they flourish;
From all evil things He spares them,
In His mighty arms He bears them.

3.
Neither life nor death shall ever
From the Lord His children sever;
Unto them His grace He showeth,
And their sorrows all He knoweth.

4.
Praise the Lord in joyful numbers,
Your Protector never slumbers;
At the will of your Defender
Ev'ry foe-man must surrender.

4.
Though he giveth or He taketh,
God His children neâ€™er forsaketh;
His the loving purpose solely
To preserve them pure and holy.
