Promised Land - C. M. and Refrain

1.
On Jordan’s stormy banks I stand,
And cast a wishful eye
To Canaan’s fair and happy land,
Where my possessions lie.

CHORUS
I am bound for the promised land,
I am bound for the promised land;
0 who will come and go with me?
1 am bound for the promised land.

2.
All o’er those wide extended plains
Shines one eternal day;
There God the Son forever reigns
And scatters night away.

3.
No chilling winds nor pois’nous breath
Can reach that healthful shore;
Sickness and sorrow, pain and death
Are felt and feared no more.

3.
When shall I reach that happy place,
And be forever blest?
When shall I see my Father’s face,
And in His bosom rest?

- Samuel Stennett
