Singing I Go

1.
The trusting heart to Jesus clings,
Nor any ill forbodes,
But at the cross of Calv’ry sings,
Praise God for lifted loads!

CHORUS
Singing, I go along life's road,
Praising the Lord, praising the Lord;
Singing, I go along life's road,
For Jesus has lifted my load.

2.
The passing days bring many
cares,
“Fear not,” I hear Him say,
And when my fears are turned to
pray’rs,
The burdens slip away.

3.
He tells me of my Father's love
And never slumb'ring eye;
My everlasting King above
Will all my needs supply.

4.
When to the throne of grace I flee,
I find the promise true,
The mighty arms upholding me
Will bear my burdens too.
