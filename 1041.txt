St. Bartholomew - L.M.

1.
Where cross the crowded ways of life,
Where sound the cries of race and clan,
Above the noise of selfish strife,
We hear Thy voice, O Son of Man.

2.
In haunts of wretchedness and need,
On shadowed thresholds dark with fears,
From paths where hide the lures of greed
We catch the vision of Thy tears.

3.
From tender childhood’s helplessness
From woman’s grief, man’s burdened toil.
From famished souls, from sorrow’s stress,
Thy heart has never known recoil.

4.
The cup of water given for Thee
Still holds the freshness of Thy grace;
Yet long these multitudes to see
The sweet compassion of Thy
face.

5.
O Master, from the mountain side,
Make haste to heal these hearts of
pain;
Among these restless throngs abide,
O tread the city's streets again;

6.
Till sons of men shall learn Thy love,
And follow where Thy feet have trod;
Till glorious from Thy heaven above,
Shall come the City of our God.
