It Is Mine

1.
God’s abiding peace is in my soul today,
Yes, I feel it now, yes, I feel it now;
He has taken all my doubts and fears away,
Tho’ I cannot tell you how.

CHORUS
It is mine, mine, blessed be His name!
He has given peace, perfect peace tome;
It is mine, mine, blessed be His name!
Mine for all eternity!

2.
He has wrought in me a sweet and perfect rest,
In my raptured heart I can feel it now;
He each passing moment keeps me saved and blest,
Floods with light my heart and brow.

3.
He has given me a never failing joy,
Oh, I have it now! Oh, I have it now!
To His praise I will my ransomed pow’rs employ,
And renew my grateful vow.

4.
Oh, the love of God is comforting my soul,
For His love is mine, yes, His love is mine!
Waves of joy and gladness o’er my spirit roll,
Thrilling me with life divine.
