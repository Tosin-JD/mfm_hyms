Cheerful Giving

1.
Give as the Lord hath prospered thee.
Give, give to the Lord;
Give with a willing mind and free,
Give, give to the Lord.
He hath supplied thee o er and o er,
Blessed thee in basket and in store,
Promised to fill thee more and more,
Thy gracious Lord.

CHORUS
Give, give with a willing hand,
Give, give with a lib'ral hand,
Give at His blest command,
Who prospered thee,
Give at His best command,
Who prospered thee.

2.
Give, to the poor along the way,
Give, give to the Lord;
Give to the heathen far away,
Give, give to the Lord;
Give to His Needy as they cry,
Give to His people ere they die,
Give to His gospel that it fly,
O give, give, give.

3.
Give, tho’ so poor thy gift may seem,
Give, give to the Lord;
Give but the cup in Jesus’ name,
Give, give to the Lord;
Cheerful then give the good thou hast,
Fearless thy bread on waters cast,
It will return to thee at last
In harvests great.

- P. H.
