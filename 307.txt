Penlan -7.6.7.6.D.

1.
Today Thy mercy calls me, To wash away my sin;
However great my trespass,
Whate’er I may have been,
However long from mercy I may have turn’d away
Thy blood, O Christ can cleanse me,
And make me white today.

2.
Today Thy gate is open,
And all who enter in,
Shall find a Father’s welcome, 
And pardon for their sin;
The past shall be forgotten,
A present joy be given,
A future grace be promised
A glorious crown in heaven.

3.
O all embracing mercy,
Thou ever open door.
What should I do without Thee,
When heart and eyes run o'er?
When all things seem against me,
To drive me to despair,
I know one gate is open,
One ear will hear my prayer.

- Oswald Allen
