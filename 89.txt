Let All the People Praise Thee

1.
O magnify the Lord with me,
Ye people of His choice,
Let all to whom He lendeth breath
Now in His name rejoice;
For love’s blest revelation,
For rest from condemnation,
For uttermost salvation
To Him give thanks.

CHORUS
Let all the people praise Thee,
Let all the people praise Thee!
Let all the people praise Thy name
Forever and forever more,
(for evermore, O Lord!)
Let all the people praise Thee,
Let all the people praise Thee!
Let all the people praise Thy name
Forever and forever more.

2.
O praise Him for His holiness,
His wisdom and His grace,
Sing praises for the precious blood
Which ransomed all our race;
In tenderness He sought us.
From depths of sin He brought us,
The way of life then taught us,
To Him give thanks.

3.
Had I a thousand tongues to sing,
The half could ne’er be told
Of love so rich, so full-and free,
Of blessings manifold;
Of grace that faileth never,
Peace flowing like a river,
From God the glorious Giver,
To Him give thanks.
