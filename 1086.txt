Jesus Understands

1.
Bow’d beneath your burden, is there none to share?
Weary with the journey, is there none to care?
Courage, way worn trav’ler, heed your Lord's commands,
There’s to cheer you, Jesus understand.

CHORUS
Yes, he understands, All his ways are best.
Hear, he calls to you, “Come to me and rest.”
Leave the unknown future in the Master’s hand,
Whether sad or joyful, Jesus understands.

2.
Ev’ry heavy burden he will gladly share,
Are you sad and weary? Jesus has a care;
Well he knows the path way o’er life’s burning sands,
Courage, fainting pilgrim, Jesus understands.

3.
Tho’ temptation meet you, Jesus can sustain,
Life has vexing problems which he can explain;
Serve him where he sends you
though in distant lands,
Do not doubt or question, Jesus understands.

4.
Weary heart, he calls you, “Come to me and rest,'*
Does the path grow rugged? yet his way is best;
Leave the unknown future in the Master's hands,
Whether sad or joyful, Jesus understands.
