St. George - S.M.

1.
How welcome was the call,
And sweet the festal lay,
When Jesus deigned in Cana’s hall
To bless the marriage day.

2.
And happy was the bride,
And glad the bridegroom’s heart;
For He who tarried at their side
Bade grief and ill depart.

3.
His gracious power divine
The water vessels knew;
And plenteous was the mystic wine
The wondering servants drew.

4.
O Lord of life and love,
Come Thou again today.
And bring a blessing from above
That ne'er shall pass away.

- Henry Williams Baker
