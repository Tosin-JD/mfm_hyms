With Joyfulness -10.9.10.9. with Ref.

1.
With joyfulness we shall work for the Master
Go we forth with willing hands to do,
Whatsoever to us He hath appointed
Faithfully our mission we’ll pursue.

CHORUS
Toiling for Jesus
Joyfully we go, yes, joyfully we go, 
Toiling for Jesus,
In His vineyard here below

2.
Sweetly, sweetly, we will tell the story
Of His love to mortals here below;
Christ, the brightness of the Father’s glory
Freely here His blessings will bestow.

3.
Meekly, meekly, toiling for the Master,
Walking, faithfully the path He trod;
Leading wanderers to the dear Redeemer
Pointing sinners to the Lamb of God.

- William A. Ogden
