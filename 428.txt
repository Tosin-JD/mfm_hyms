Infant Praise - 7.7.7.7. and Refrain

1.
Children of Jerusalem
Sang the praise of Jesus' name:
Children, too, of modem days.
Join to sing the Saviour's praise.

CHORUS
Hark, hark, hark! while infant voices sing,
Hark, hark, hark! while infant voices sing
Loud hosannas, loud hosannas
loud hosannas to our King.

2.
We are taught to love the Lord,
We are taught to read His Word,
We are taught the way to heaven;
Praise for all to God be given.

3.
Parents, teachers, old and young,
All unite to swell the song;
Higher and yet higher rise,
Till hosannas reach the skies.
