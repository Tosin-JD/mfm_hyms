Oh, Wonderful, Wonderful Word Of The Lord

1.
Oh, wonderful, wonderful Word of the Lord!
True wisdom its pages unfold:
And though we may read them a thousand time o’er.
They never, no, never grow old.
Each line hath a treasure, each promise a pearl,
That all if they will may secure;
And we know that when time and the world pass away.
God’s Word shall for ever endure.

2.
Oh, wonderful, wonderful Wordof the Lord!
The lamp that our Father above
So kindly has lighted to teach us the way
That leads to the arms of His love!
Its warnings, its counsels, are faithful and just;
Its judgements are perfect and pure;
And we know that when time and the world pass away;
God’s Word shall for ever endure.

3.
Oh, wonderful, wonderful Word of the Lord!
Our only salvation is there;
It carries conviction down deep in the heart,
And shows us ourselves as we are
It tells of a Saviour, and points to the cross,
Where pardon we now may secure;
For we know that when time and the world pass away;
God’s Word shall for ever endure.

4.
Oh, wonderful, wonderful Word of the Lord!
The hope of our friends in the past;
Its truth here so firmly they anchored their truth,
Through ages eternal shall last.
Oh, wonderful, wonderful Word of the Lord!
Unchanging, abiding, and sure;
For we know that when time and the world pass away;
God’s Word shall for ever endure.
