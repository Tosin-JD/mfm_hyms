St. Magnus - C. M.

1.
The Lord will come and not be slow,
His footsteps cannot err;
Before Him righteousness shall go,
His royal harbinger.

2.
Truth from the earth, like to a flower,
Shall bud and blossom then;
And justice, from her heavenly bower,
Look down on mortal men.

3.
Rise, God, judge Thou the earth in might,
This wicked earth redress;
For Thou art He Who shall by right
The nations all possess.

4.
For great Thou art, and wonders great
By Thy strong hand are done:
Thou in Thy everlasting seat
Remainest God alone.

- John Milton
