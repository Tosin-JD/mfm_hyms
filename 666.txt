666
I Am Determined To Hold Out

1.
When I first found Jesus something o’er me stole,
Like lighting it went through me, and glory filled my soul;
Salvation made me happy and took my fears away,
And when I meet old Satan to him I always say;

CHORUS
“I am determined to hold out to the end,
Jesus is with me, on ‘Him I can depend,
And I know I have salvation, for I feet it in my soul,
I am determined to hold out to the end.”

2.
Satan, He was angry, said he’d soon be back,
Just let the path get narrow, and He will lose the track;
But I’m so full of glory, my Lord I always find,
And I just say to Satan, “Old man, get thee behind."

3.
This old time religion makes me sometimes shout,
I don’t have time to gossip nor any time to pout;
They say that I'm too noisy, but when these blessings flow,
I shout, O hallelujah, I want the world to know.

4.
When I hear the trumpet sounding in the sky.
And see the mountain trembling, to heaven
I will fly For Jesus will be calling, there’ll be no time to mend,
With joy I’ll go up singing. “I’ve held out to the end.”
