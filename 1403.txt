Mylon - C. M.

1.
Give me the wing$ of faith to rise
Within the veil, and see
The saints above, how great their joys.
How bright thejj glories be.

2.
Once they were mourners here below,
And poured out cries and tears;
They wrestled hard, as we do now,
With sins, and doubts, and fears.

3.
I ask them whence their victory came.
They, with united breath.
Ascribe their conquest to the Lamb,
Their triumph to His death.

4.
They marked the footsteps that He trod,
His zeal inspired their breast;
And, following their incarnate God,
Possess the promised rest.

5.
Our glorious Leader claims our praise
For His own pattern given;
While the long cloud of witnessess
Show the same path to heaven.

- Isaac Watts
