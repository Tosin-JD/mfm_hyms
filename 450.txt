Shirland - S.M.

1.
When shall Thy love constrain,
And force me to Thy breast?
When shall my soul return again
To her eternal rest?

2.
Thy condescending grace
To me did freely move;
It calls me still to seek Thy face,
And stoops to ask my love.

3.
Lord, at Thy feet I fall!
I long to be set free;
I fain would now obey the call.
And give up all for Thee.

4.
To rescue me from woe,
Thou didst with all things part:
Didst lead a suffering life below.
To gain my worthless heart.

5.
My worthless heart to gain,
The God of all that breathe
Was found in fashion as a man.
And died a cursed death.

6.
And can I yet delay
My little all to give?
To tear my soul from earth away,
For Jesus to receive?

7.
Nay, but I yield, I yield!
I can hold out no more,
I sink, by dying love compelled,
And own Thee conqueror.

- Charles Wesley
