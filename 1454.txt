Some Golden Daybreak

1.
Some glorious morning sorrow will cease,
Some glorious morning all will be peace;
Heart aches all ended, Labour all done,
Heaven will open Jesus will come.

CHORUS
Some golden day break Jesus will come;
Some golden day break, battles all won,
He'll shout the vict’ry, break thro’ the blue,
Some golden day break, for me, for you.

2.
Sad hearts will gladden, all shall be bright,
Goodbye forever to earth’s dark night;
Changed in a moment, like Him to be,
Oh, glorious daybreak, Jesus I’ll see.

3.
Oh, what a meeting, there in the skies,
No tears nor crying shall dim our eyes;
Loved ones united eternally,
Oh, what a day break that morn will be.

- C. A. Blackmore
