406
Higher Ground

1.
I’m pressing on the upward way,
New heights I'm gaining ev’ry day;
Still praying as I’m onward bound,
“Lord, plant my feet on higher
ground.
CHORUS
Lord, lift me up and let me stand,
By faith, on Heaven’s table land,
A higher plane than I have found;
Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.

2.
My heart has no desire to stay
Where doubts arise and fears
dismay;
Tho’ some may dwell where these
abound,
My prayer, my aim is higher
ground.”
3 I want to live above the world,
Tho' Satan’s darts at me are hurled;
For faith has caught the joyful
sound.
The song of saints on higher
ground.”4. I want to scale the utmost height
And catch a gleam of glory bright;
But still I’ll pray till Heav’n I’ve
found,
“Lord, lead me on to higher
ground.”
