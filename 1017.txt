ALL THE WAY


1.
Jesus, blessed Jesus, lead me
All along life’s way,
With the Holy Manna feed me,
Ev’ry hour and day,
Keep me ever close beside Thee,
Lest my feet shoud roam,
And when this life is over,
Lead me safely home.

CHORUS
All the way, All the way.
Saviour, lead me all the way,
To that land of endless day.
Saviour lead me all the way.

2.
Jesus, blessed Jesus, lead me
Where e’er duty calls,
Tho’ it be o’er lonely mountains. Or
beside stone walls,
In the home of poor and lowly,
I will spread the light,
Point the sad and weary traveler
To the pathway bright.

3.
Jesus, blessed Jesus, lead me
In the gospel fight,
Help me battle ev’ry error,
Stand for truth and right,
With God’s pow’r to go before me I can conquer sin,
With Thy banner floating o’er me.
Life’s hard battle win.

4.
Jesus, blessed Jesus, lead me Till I see God’s face,
'Till His smile shall rest upon me,
Filled with matchless grace,
Then when I have passed the portals
To that land above,
I shall praise Thee with immortalsFor redeeming love.
