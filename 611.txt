When the King Comes!


1.
They come and go, the season fair,
And bring their spoil to vale and hills;
But oh, there is waiting in the air,
And a passionate hope the spirit fills.
Why doth He tarry, the absent Lord?
When shall the Kingdom be restored,
And earth and heav’n, with one accord,
Ring out the cry that the King comes?

CHORUS
What will it be when the King comes!
What will it be when the King comes!
What will it be when the King comes!
What will it be when the King comes!

2.
The floods have lifted upon their voice;
The King hath come to His own His own!
The little hills and vales rejoice,
His right it is to take the crown.
Sleepers, awake, and meet Him first!
Now let the marriage hymn out burst!
And powers of darkness flee, disperst
What will it be when the King comes!

3.
A ransomed earth breaks forth in song,
Her sin-stained ages over past;
Her yearning, “Lord, how long,?
“Exchanged for joy at last at last!
Angels, carry the royal commands;
Peace beams forth thro’ out all the lands:
The trees of the field shall clap their hands
What will it be when the King comes!

4.
Now Zion’s hill, with glory crowned,
Uplifts her head with joy once more;
And Zion’s King, once scorned, disowned,
Extends her rule from shore to shore.
Sing, for the land her Lord regains!
Sing, for the Son of David reigns!
And living streams o’er flow her plains
What will it be when the King comes!

5.
O brothers, stand as men that wait,
The dawn is purpling in the east
And banners wave from heaven’s high gate:
The conflict now but soon the feast.
Mercy and truth shall meet again;
Worthy the Lamb that once was slain;
We can suffer now He will know us then
What will it be when the King comes!
