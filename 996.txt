Salonica -4.10.10.10.4.

1.
Come, labour on!
Who dares stand idle on the harvest plain,
While all around him waves the golden grain?
And to each servant doth the Master say
"Go, work today!"


2.
Come, labour on!
Claim the high calling angels cannot share,
To young and old the gospel gladness bear:
Redeem the time; its hours too swiftly fly;
The night draws nigh.

3.
Come, labour on!
Away with gloomy doubt and faithless fear!
No arm so weak but may do service here;
By hands the feeblest can our God fulfil
His righteous will.

4.
Come, labour on!
No time for rest, till glows the western sky.
Till the long shadows o'er our pathway lie,
And a glad sound comes with the setting sun.
'Servant, well done!'

5.
Come, labour on!
The toil is pleasant and the harvest sure;
Blessed are those who to the end endure:
How full their joy, how deep their rest shall be
0 Lord, with Thee!
