No One Understands – 8.7.8.7. with Refrain

1.
No one understands like Jesus
He s a friend beyond compare;
Meet Him at the throne of mercy,
He is waiting for you there.

CHORUS
No one understands like Jesus,
When the days are dark and grim;
No one is so near, so dear as Jesus,
Cast your every care on Him.

2.
No one understands like Jesus,
Every woe He sees and feels;
Tenderly He whispers comfort,
And the broken heart He heals.

3.
No one understands like Jesus,
When the foes of life assail;
You should never be discouraged,
Jesus cares and will not fail.

4.
No one understands like Jesus,
When you falter on the way;
Tho’ you fail Him, sadly fail Him,
He will pardon you today.
