Oh, come to me - L.M.

1.
Wouldst thou, O weary soul, be blest?
In Christ the Lord thy Saviour see;
His grace alone can give thee rest,
And lo! He calleth, “Come to Me!

CHORUS
Oh, come to Me! Oh, come to Me!
The Saviour calleth, “Come to Me,
Ye heavy laden, Come to Me,
And I will give, will give you rest.”

2.
He does not wait for greater worth,
Or more of holiness in thee;
He brings good news to all the earth,
And still He calleth, “Come to Me!”

3.
Hast thou not sinned ten thousand times?
His pardoning grace will set thee free;
Count unbelief the worst of crimes,
And trust thy Saviour’s “Come to Me!”

4.
Eternal life is in His Word,
He asks thee now His child to be;
No sweeter sound was ever heard
Than His most gracious "Come to Me!”

5.
Be this thine answer now, and here:
“Since Thou hast kindly called for me.
Thy tender love dispels my fear;
I come, I come, O Lord, to Thee!”

- Rev. J. Clark
