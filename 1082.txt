1082
Able to Deliver

1.
O troubled heart, be thou not afraid.
In the Lord thy God let thy hope be stay’d;
He will hear thy cry and will give thee aid,
Whate’er thy cross may be.

CHORUS
He is able still to deliver thee.
And His own right hand thy defence shall be;
He is able still to deliver thee,
Then be thou not afraid.

2.
O troubled heart, tho’ thy foes unite.
Let thy faith be strong and thy armour bright:
Thou shalt over come thro’ His power and might,
And more than conq’ror be.

3.
O troubled heart, when thy way is drear,
He will rescue thee and dispel thy fear:
In thy greatest need He is always near
To Him all glory be!
