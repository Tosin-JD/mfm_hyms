ALL THE WAY

1.
All the way my Saviour leads me;
What have I to ask beside?
Can I doubt His tender mercy,
Who thru life has been my guide?
Heav’nly peace, divinest comfort,
Here by faith in Him to dwell!
For I know whate’er befall me,
Jesus doeth all things well.

2.
All the way my Saviour leads me;
Cheers each winging path I tread,
Gives me grace for ev'ry trial,
Feeds me with the living bread:
Tho' my weary steps may falter.
And my soul athirst may be,
Gushing from the Rock before,
Lo! A spring of joy I see.

3.
All the way my Saviour leads me;
Oh, the fullness of His love!
Perfect rest to me is promised
In my Father’s house above:
When my spirit, cloth'd immortal,
Wings its flight to realms of day,
This my song thru endless ages:
Jesus led me all the way.
