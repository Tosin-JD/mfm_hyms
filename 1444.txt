We’ll Understand It Better

1.
We are often tossed and driv'n
on the restless sea of time.
Somber skies and howling tempests
oft succeed a bright sunshine.
In that land of perfect day,
When the mists have rolled away,
We will understand it better by and by.

CHORUS
By and by, when the morning comes.
When the saints of God are gathered home,
We’ll tell the story How we’ve over come;
For we'll understand it better by and by.

2.
We are often destitute
of the things that life demands,
Want of food and want of shelter,
thirsty hills and barren lands,
We are trusting in the Lord,
and according to His Word,
We will understand it better by and by

3.
Trials dark on ev’ry hand,
and we cannot understand,
All the ways that God would lead us
to that blessed Promised Land;
But He guides us with His eye,
and we'll follow till we die;
For we’ll understand it better by and by.

4.
Temptations, hidden snares
often take us unawares,
And our hearts are made to bleed
for many a thoughtless word or deed,
And we wonder why the test
when we try to do our best,
But we’ll understand it better by and by.

- C. A. Tindley
