Our times are in Thy hand

1.
“Our times are in Thy hand:"
Father, we wish them there;
Our life, our soul, our all,
We leave entirely to Thy care.

2.
“Our times are in Thy hand,”
Whatever they may be;
Pleasing or painful, dark or bright,
As best may seem to Thee.

3.
“Our times are in Thy hand;”
Why should we doubt or fear?
Our Father’s hand will never cause
His child a needless tear.

4.
“Our times are in Thy hand,”
Jesus, the crucified!
The hand our cruel sins had pierced.
Is now our guard and guide.
