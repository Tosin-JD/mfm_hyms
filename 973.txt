Diademata • S.M.D.


1.
Soldiers of Christ, arise
And put your armor on.
Strong in the strength which God supplies
Through His eternal Son;
Strong in the Lord of hosts,
And in His mighty pow’r,
Who in the strength of Jesus trusts
Is more than conqueror.

2.
Stand then in His great might,
With all His strength endued,
And take, to arm you for the fight,
The panoply of God;
From strength to strength go or
Wrestle and fight and pray;
Tread all the pow’rs of darkness
down.
And win the well fought day.

3.
Leave no unguarded place.
No weakness of the soul;
Take every virture, ev'ry grace,
And fortify the whole.
That having all things done.
And all your conflicts past.
Ye may o’er come through Christ alone.
And stand complete at last.

4.
Leave no unguarded place.
No weakness of the soul.
Take every virtue, every grace,
And fortify the whole.
Indissolubly joined.
To battle all proceed;
But arm yourselves with all the mind
That was in Christ, your Head

- Charles Wesley
