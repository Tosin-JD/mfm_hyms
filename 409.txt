I Am Praying For You

1.
I have a Saviour, He's pleading in glory,
A dear, loving Saviour, though earth
friends be few;
And now He is watching in tenderness o’er me,
And, oh, that my Saviour were your
Saviour, too.
CHORUSFor you I am praying, For you I am
praying,
For you I am praying, I’m praying
for you.

2.
I have a Father; to me He has given
A hope for eternity, blessed and
true;
And soon will He call me to meet
Him in heaven,
But, oh,that He’d let me bring you
with me, too!

3.
I have a robe: tis resplendent in
whiteness,
Awaiting in glory my wondering
view;
Oh, when I receive it all shining in
brightness
Dear friend, could I see you
receiving one, too!

4.
When Jesus has found you, tell
others the story,
That my loving Saviour is your
Saviour, too;
Then pray that your Saviour may
bring them to glory,
And prayer will be answered twas
answered for you! i
