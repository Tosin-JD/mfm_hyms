Gaudete – 8.6.8.6.4.

1.
Joy fills our inmost heart today:
The royal Child is born:
And angel hosts in glad array
His Advent keep this morn.

CHORUS
Rejoice, rejoice! The incarnate Word
Has come on earth to dwell;
No sweeter sound than this is heard
Emmanuel.

2.
Low at the cradle throne we bend,
We wonder and adore;
And feel no bliss can our transcend,
No joy was sweet before.

3.
For us the world must lose its charms
Before the manger shrine,
When, folded in Thy mother’s arms
We see Thee, Babe divine.

4.
Thou Light of uncreated Light,
Shine on us, Holy Child;
That we may keep Thy birthday bright,
With service undefiled.

- S. Smith
