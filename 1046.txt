1046
God Leads Us Along

1.
In shady, green pastures, so rich
and so sweet,
God leads His dear children along,
Where the water's cool flow bathes
the weary one’s feet,
God leads His dear children along.

CHORUS
Some thru the waters, some thru the flood,
Some thru the fire, but all thru the blood;
Some thru great sorrow, but God gives a song,
In the night season and all the day long.

2.
Sometimes on the mount where the sunshines so bright,
God leads His dear children along;
Sometimes in the valley, in darkest of night,
God leads His dear children along.

3.
Tho’ sorrow befall us and Satan oppose,
God leads His dear children along;
Thru grace we can conquer, defeat all our foes,
God leads His dear children along.

4.
Away from the mire and away from the clay,
God leads His dear children along;
Away up in glory, eternity’s day,
God leads His dear children along.

- G. A. Young
