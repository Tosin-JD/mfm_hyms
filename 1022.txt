Jesus shall lead me - L.M. and Refrain

1.
Where He may lead me I will go,
For I have team'd to trust Him so,
And I remember 'twas for me,
That He was slain on Calvary.

CHORUS
Jesus shall lead me night and day,
Jesus shall lead me all the way;
He is the truest Friend to me,
For I remember Calvary.

2.
O I delight in His command,
Love to be led by His dear hand,
His divine will is sweet to me,
Hallow’d by blood stain’d Calvary.

3.
Onward I go, nor doubt nor fear.
Happy with Christ, my Saviour near,
Trusting some day that I shall see,
Jesus, my Friend of Calvary.

- W. C. Martin
