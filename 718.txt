1 Great Shepherd of your people, hear!
your presence now display;
as you have given a place for
prayer,
so give us hearts to pray.

2.
Within these walls let holy peace
and love and friendship dwell;
here give the troubled conscience
ease,
the wounded spirit heal.

3. 
May we in faith receive your word,
in faith present our prayers;
and in the presence of our Lord
unburden all our cares.

4.
The hearing ear, the seeing eye,
the contrite heart bestow;
and shine upon us from on high,
that we in grace may grow.

- J. Newton
