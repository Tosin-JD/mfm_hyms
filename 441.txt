The Blood will never lose its Power

1.
In the misty days of yore,
Jesus’ precious blood had pow’r
E’en the thief upon the Cross to save;
Like a bird his spirit flies to its home in Paradise,
Thro' the pow'r of Calv’ry’s crimson wave.

CHORUS
And the blood has never lost its pow’r,
No, never; no, never;
Jesus’ blood avails for sin ever,
And will never lose its pow’r.

2.
I was lost and steep'd in guilt’
but the blood for sinners spilt
Wash’d away my sins and set me free;
Now and evermore the same, praise,
O praise His holy name!
Will the cleansing stream availing be.

3.
God in mercy asks you why,
brother sinner, will you die,
When such full redemption He provides?
You have but to look and live,
life eternal He will give,
For the pow’r of Calvary still abides.

4.
Bring your burdens, come today,
turn from all your sins away,
He can fully save and sanctify;
From the wrath to come now flee,
let your name recorded be
With the blood washed, and redeemed on high.
