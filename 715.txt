Spend a Moment with Jesus

1.
Spend a moment in pray'r with the Saviour,
When the pathway is lonely and long;
He will turn all the shadows to sunshine,
And your sorrow and sighing to song.

CHORUS
Moment praying to the dear Saviour,
Burden is so heavy to bear;
Then your burdens of care will be lifted,
Spend a moment with Jesus a moment in pray'r.

2.
Spend a moment in pray’r with the Saviour,
When the tempter is lingering near;
He will give you His strength in your weakness,
And His love light will fill you with cheer.

3.
Spend a moment in pray'r with the Saviour,
When your spirit is sad and oppressed;
O what comfort to hear His soft whisper,
“Come to Me, weary one, and find rest.”

4.
Spend a moment in pray'r with the Saviour,
It will keep you from doubt and despair;
Ev'ry morning and noontide and evening,
Spend a moment with Jesus in pray’r.

- Rev. Alfred Barratt
