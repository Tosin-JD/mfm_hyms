Win Them for him

1.
Just to tell the Savior’s story,
Just to witness for His glory,
There are many waiting in their
doubt and blindness, Win them for Him!
Speak a word to friend or neighbour,
joyous for the Master is labour,
telling of His joy divine, His
love and kindness, Win them for Him!

CHORUS
Serve Him, labour for His glory,
and your witness He will bless,
Serve Him, tell the wondrous stray,
and His love divine confess, and gladly
Serve Him, pointing those around you
to the Light that ne’er can dim,
Haste, for days are winging, souls to
Jesus bringing, Win them for Him!

2.
Just a word, the King confessing,
Just to point the path to blessing,
Some have never, never heard the
call so tender. Win them for Him!
There is work that wait your doing,
Eager haste, your strength renewing,
Service for the Master you can
daily render, Win them for Him!

3.
Just to live a life so lowly,
Witness for the King so holy,
Let your light so shine that those
around may know Him, Win them for Him!
Just a word, His voice obeying,
Just a word to help the straying,
Tell them of a Savour blest,
how much we owe Him, Win them for Him!
