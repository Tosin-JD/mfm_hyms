379
Whosoever Meaneth Me

1.
l am happy today and the sun shines bright.
The clouds have been rolled away;
For the Saviour said, Whosoever will
May come with Him to stay.

CHORUS
“Whosoever,” surely meaneth me.
Surely meaneth me, O surely meaneth me;
“Whosoever,” surely meaneth me.
“Whosoever," meaneth me.

2.
All my hopes have been raised, O
His name be praised.
His glory has filled my soul;
I've been lifted up, and from sin set free.
His blood has made me whole.

3.
O what wonderful love, O what grace divine,
That Jesus should die for me;
I was lost in sin, for the world I pined,
But now I am set free.
