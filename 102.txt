GLORY TO THEE, WHO SAFE HAST KEPT

1.
Glory to Thee, who safe hast kept
And hast refreshed me whilst I slept;
Grant, Lord, when I from death shall wake
I may of endless life partake.

2.
Lord, I my vows to Thee renew;
Disperse my sins as morning dew;
Guard my first springs of thought and will,
And with Thyself my spirit fill.

3.
Direct, control, suggest, this day
All I design or do or say;
That all my powers, with all their might,
In Thy sole glory may unite.

4.
Praise God, from whom all blessings flow,
Praise Him, all creatures here below,
Praise Him above, ye heavenly host,
Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.
