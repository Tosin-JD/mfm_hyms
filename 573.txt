O Holy Spirit, Come - S.M.

1.
O Holy Spirit, come,
Anoint us one and all,
And let some mighty deed be done,
While at Thy feet we fall.

2.
Thy Presence now we feel,
To Thee our all we give,
Oh, let Thy love our spirits seal
Henceforth for Thee to live.

3.
The glow of love divine
Refines us, at Thy feet;
For this our souls will always pine
And yearn to be complete.

4.
O unction from on high,
Come, permeate within;
Then I shall bear Thy searching eye
Without a trace of sin.
