CHRIST RETURNETH


1.
It may be at morn, when the day is awaking,
When sunlight thro’ darkness and shadow is breaking,
That Jesus will come in the fullness of glory,
To receive from the world “His own.”

CHORUS
O Lord Jesus, how long, how long
Ere we shout the glad song,
Christ returneth! Hallelujah!
Hallelujah! Amen,
Hallelujah! Amen.

2.
It may be at mid-day, it may beat twilight,
It may be, perchance, that the blackness of mid-night
Will burst into light in the blaze of His glory,
When Jesus receives “His own.”

3.
While its host cry Hosanna, from heaven descending,
With glorified saints and the angels attending,
With grace on His brow, like a halo of glory,
Will Jesus receive “His own.”

4.
Oh, joy! oh, delight!
Should we go without dying,
No sickness, no sadness, no dread and no crying,
Caught up thro’ the clouds with our Lord into glory,
When Jesus receives “His own.”
