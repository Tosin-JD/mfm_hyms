Trentham - S.M.

1.
O Love of God most full,
O Love of God most free.
Come, warm my heart, come, fill my soul,
Come, lead me unto Thee!

2.
Warm as the glowing sun.
So shines Thy love on me;
It wraps me ‘round with kindly care,
It draws me unto Thee!

3.
The wildest sea is calm,
The tempest brings no fear,
The darkest night is full of light
Because Thy love is near.

4.
O Love of God most full,
0 Love of God most free,
Thou warm’st my heart, Thou fill’st my soul,
With might Thou strength 'nest me.
