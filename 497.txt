Gratitude - 6.6.6.6.8.8.

1.
On wings of living light,
At earliest dawn of day,
Came down the angel bright,
And rolled the stone away.

CHORUS
Your voices raise with one accord,
To bless and praise your risen Lord.

2.
The keepers, watching near,
At that dread sight and sound
Fell down with sudden fear
Like a\dead men to the ground:

3.
Then rose from death’s dark gloom,
Unseen by mortal eye,
Triumphant o’er the tomb,
The Lord of earth and sky!

4.
Ye children of the light,
Arise with Him, arise
See how the Day star bright
Is burning in the skies!

5.
Leave in the grave beneath
The old things passed away;
Buried with Him in death,
Olive with Him today!

6.
We sing Thee, Lord Divine,
With all our hearts and powers,
For we are ever Thine,
And Thou art ever ours.

- William Walsham How
