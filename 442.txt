Grace of God the Father

1.
Grace of God the Father, Grace of God the Son,
Grace of God the Spirit, blessed Three in One.
Came in all its beauty light and life to bring,
Chase away the shadows, make sad hearts to sing.

CHORUS
Grace, grace, wondrous gift of God
to all the human race;
Grace, grace, bountiful and free,
found in every place;
Grace, grace, beautiful and sweet,
would all mankind embrace;
Grace, grace, every one may taste
Godâ€™s great gift of grace.

2.
Where sin is abounding, Grace abundeth more;
Precious is the message, boundless is the store;
Never be discouraged, Grace is flowing free,
Higher than the heavens, deeper than the sea.

3.
Now this grace is kindly Offered every soul,
Come with all your burdens, Grace will make you whole:
"Him that cometh to Me I will not cast out,
But will love Him freely, Come and do not doubt."
