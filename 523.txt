Rachie -6.5.

1.
Golden harps are sounding,
Angel voices ring
Pearly gates are open’d
Open’d for the King;
Jesus, King of glory,
Jesus, King of love,
Is gone up in triumph to
His throne above.

CHORUS
All His work is ended,
Joyfully we sing,
Jesus hath ascended;
Glory to our King.

2.
He who came to save us,
He who bled and died
Now is crowned with glory
At His Father’s side.
Nevermore to suffer,
Nevermore to die;
Jesus, King of glory,
Is gone up on high.

3.
Praying for His children
In that blessed place;
Calling them to glory,
Sending them His grace;
His bright home preparing,
Faithful ones for you;
Jesus ever liveth,
Ever loveth too.

- F. R. Havergal
