Showers Of Blessing - 8.7.8.7. with Refrain

1.
‘There shall be showers of blessing"
This is the promise of love;
There shall be seasons refreshing,
Sent from the Saviour above.

CHORUS
Showers of blessing,
Showers of blessing we need;
Mercy drops round us are falling,
But for the showers we plead.

2.
"There shall be showers of blessing’’
Precious reviving again;
Over the hills and the valleys,
Sound of abundance of rain,

3.
“There shall be showers of blessing”
Send them upon us, O Lord,
Grant to us now a refreshing,
Come and now honour Your Word.

4.
“There shall be showers of blessing”
O that today they might fall,
Now as to God we're confessing,
Now as on Jesus we call!

- Daniel W. Whittle
