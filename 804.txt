Somebody Loves Me

1.
I’m in love with my Saviour and He’s in love with me,
He is with me from day to day,
What a friend is He;
Watches over me while I sleep,
Hears me when I pray,
I am happy as I can be, And I now can say:

CHORUS
Somebody loves me, answers my prayer,
I love somebody, I know He cares;
Somebody tells me not to repine,
That Somebody is Jesus, and I know He's mine.

2.
You’ll be happy if you will let Jesushave His way,
He has work for us all to do Ev'ry passing day;
Feed the hungry and cheer the sad,
For the sinner, pray.
You’ll have joy that you never had,
And you then can say:

3.
Then at last when our work is done,
He will call us home
To a mansion He has prepared Never more to roam,
We'll sit down by the riverside,
Cares all passed away,
And with never a pain to bear, What a happy day.
