1312
The Son Hath Made Me Free

1.
I was once in Egypt’s bondage,
But deliv’rance came to me;
And I’m living now in Canaan.
For the Son hath made me free.

CHORUS
I am dwelling now in Canaan, now in Canaan,
Jesus’ blood avails for me, yes, for me;
I am free from condemnation, condemnation,
For the Son hath made me free.

2.
I was once a slave to Satan.
And he worked his will in me;
But I’m bound by sin no longer.
For the Son hath made me free.

3.
Ere I entered in to Canaan.
Inbred sin remained in me;
But from it I’ve found a cleansing.
For the Son hath made me free.

4.
All my fear, all condemnation.
All that stood ‘twixt God and me;
Praise His name! are left behind me.
For the Son hath made me free.
