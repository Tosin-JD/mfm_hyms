Wonderful Peace

1.
Coming to Jesus, my Saviour, I found
Wonderful peace, wonderful peace;
Storms in their fury may rage all
around,
I have peace, sweet peace.
CHORUS
Peace, peace, wonderful peace.
Peace, peace, glorious peace;
Since my Redeemer has ransomed
my soul,
I have peace, sweet peace.

2.
Peace like a river, so deep and so
broad,
Wonderful peace, wonderful peace;
Resting my soul on the bosom of
God.
I have peace, sweet peace.
3 Peace like a holy and infinite calm.
Wonderful peace, wonderful peace.
Like to the strains of an evening
psalm,
I have peace, sweet peace

4.
Gone is the battle that once raged
within,
Wonderful peace, wonderful peace;
Jesus has saved me and cleansed
me from sin,
l have peace, sweet peace.
