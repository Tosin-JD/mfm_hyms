LEADER OF FAITHFUL SOULS, AND GUIDE

1.
Leader of faithful souls, and Guide
Of all that travel to the sky.
Come and with us, e’en us, abide,
Who would on Thee alone rely.
On Thee alone our spirits stay,
While held in life’s uneven way.

2.
We have no lasting city here,
But seek a city out of sight;
Thither our steady course we steer,
Aspiring to the plains of light,
Jerusalem, the saints’ abode.
Whose founder is the living God.

3.
Through Thee, who all our sins hast borne,
Freely and graciously forgiven,
With songs to Zion we return,
Contending for our native heaven;
That palace of our glorious King,
We find it nearer while we sing.

4.
Raised by the breath of love divine,
We urge our way with strength renewed;
The Church of Thy first born to join.
We travel to the mount of God.
With joy upon our heads arise,
And meet our Captain in the skies.

- Charles Wesley
