The love of Jesus - 7.6.

1.
What a blessed hope is mine,
Through the love of Jesus!
I’m an heir of life Divine,
Through the love of Jesus!

CHORUS
He will my soul defend;
He, my unchanging Friend;
He will keep me to the end:
All glory be to Jesus!

2.
I can sing without a rear,
Praise the name of Jesus!
He, my present help, is near,
Praise the name of Jesus!

3.
Pressing on my pilgrim way.
Trusting only Jesus!
Oh, 'tis joy from day to day,
Trusting only jesus!

4.
Thus my journey I’ll pursue,
Looking unto Jesus!
Till the land of rest I view,
There to dwell with Jesus!

- Robert Bruce
