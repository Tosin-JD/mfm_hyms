Come Just As You Are

1.
Ye who are troubled and burdened by sin,
Come just as you are.
Come to the Saviour, a new life begin.
Oh, come just as you are!

CHORUS
Come just as you are. Oh,
come just as you are!
Turn from your sin, let the Saviour come in,
And come just as you are.

2.
Deep in your heart sin has written its scar;
Come just as you are.
Tho from your Father you've wandered afar,
Oh, come just as you are!

3.
Sinful and guilty, heart broken and lost,
Come just as you are.
Think what your ransom on Calvary cost!
Oh, come just as you are!

4.
Naught of your goodness for sin can atone;
Come just as you are.
Trust in the merit of Jesus alone,
And come just as you are!

5.
Come with your heart ache, your sorrow and pain;
Come just as you are.
No one has come to the Saviour in vain.
Oh come just as you are!
