586
When He comes in glory by and by

1.
O how sweet â€˜twill be to meet the Lord,
When He comes in glory, by and by;
What a song of praise will be outpoured,
When He comes in glory, by and by.

CHORUS
How sweet! how sweet!
When He comes in the sky!
What joy! what joy!
When He comes in glory, by and by.

2.
We will have our robes all white as snow,
When He comes in glory,
by and by; O be ready, with the Lord to go,
When He comes in glory, by and by.

3.
I am longing for that happy day,
When He comes in glory,
by and by; For with Him I hope to soar away,
When He comes in glory, by and by.
