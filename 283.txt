Oh, why not tonight

1.
Oh, do not let the word depart.
And close thine eyes against the light;
Poor sinner, harden not your heart,
Be saved oh, tonight.

CHORUS
Oh, why not tonight!
Oh, why not tonight?
Wilt thou be saved?
Then why not tonight?

2.
Tomorrowâ€™s sun may never rise,
To bless thy long deluded sight;
This is the time, oh, then be wise,
Be saved oh, tonight.

3.
Our Lord in pity lingers still,
And wilt thou thus His love requite?
Renounce at once thy stubborn will,
Be saved oh, tonight.

4.
Our blessed Lord refuses none
Who would to Him their souls unite;
Believe, obey, the work is done,
Be saved oh, tonight.
