Joy Cometh in the Morning

1.
Oh, weary pilgrim, lift your head:
For joy cometh in the morning!
For God in His own Word hath said
That joy cometh in the morning!

CHORUS
Joy cometh in the morning!
Joy cometh in the morning!
Weeping may endure for a night;
But joy cometh in the morning!

2.
Ye trembling saints, dismiss yourfears;
For joy cometh in the morning!
Oh, weary mourner, dry your tears:
For joy cometh in the morning!

3.
Rejoice! the night will soon be gone:
For joy cometh in the morning!
And then shall come the glorious dawn:
For joy cometh in the morning!

4.
Oh, may we all be glad today!
For joy cometh in the morning!
Our God shall wipe all tears away:
For joy cometh in the morning!
