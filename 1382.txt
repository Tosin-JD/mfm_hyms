This Little Light of Mine

1.
This little of mine,
I’m going to let it shine,
Oh, this little light of mine,
I’m going to let it shine, Hallelujah,
This little light of mine.
I’m going to let it shine,
let it shine, let It shine, let it shine.

2.
Ev'ry where I go,
I'm going to let it shine,
Oh, ev’ry where I go,
I’m going to let it shine, Hallelujah,
Ev’ry where I go,
I’m going to let it shine,
let it shine, let it shine, let it shine.

3.
All in my house,
I’m going to let it shine,
Oh, all in my house,
I'm going to let it shine, Hallelujah,
All rn my house,
I’m going to let it shine,
let it shine, let it shine, let it shine.

4.
I’m not going to make it shine,
I’m just going to let it shine,
I’m not going to make it shine,
I’m just going to let it shine,
Hallelujah,
I’m not going to make it shine,
I’m just going to let it shine,
let it shine, let it shine, let it shine.

5.
Out in the dark,
I’m going to let it shine,
Oh, out in the dark,
I’m going to let it shine, Hallelujah,
Out in the dark,
I’m going to let it shine,
let it shine, let it shine, let it shine.
