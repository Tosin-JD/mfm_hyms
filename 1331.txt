1.
O Spirit of the living God,
in all the fulnesss of your grace,
wherever human feet have trod,
descend upon our fallen race:

2.
Give tongues of fire and hearts of love
to preach the reconciling word;
anoint with power from heaven above
whenever gospel truth is heard:

3.
Let darkness turn to radiant light,
confusion vanish from your path;
those who are weak inspire with might:
let mercy triumph over wrath!

4.
O Spirit of our God, prepare
the whole wide world the Lord to
meet;breathe out new life, like morning air,
till hearts of stone begin to beat:

5.
Baptize the nations; far and near
the triumphs of the cross record;
till Christ in glory shall appear
and every race declare him Lord!
