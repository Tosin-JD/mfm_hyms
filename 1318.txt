1318
He Touched Me - Irregular meter

1.
Shackled by a heavy burden,
â€˜Neath a load of guilt and shame;
Then the hand of Jesus touched me,
And now I am no longer the same.

CHORUS
He touched me, O, He touched me,
And O, the joy that floods my soul;
Something happened, and now I know,
He touched me and made me whole.

2.
Since I met this blessed Saviour,
Since He cleansed and made me whole;
I will never cease to praise Him,
I'll shout it while eternity rolls.

- William J. Gaither
