St Buudwater - C. M.
1 When Jesus enter'd the Temple
The shout of praise, we heard
The children acknowledged His right
And they rejoic'd in Him

2.
Hosannah raise the Temple high
And mixed with divers tongues
Hosannah to the King of heav'n
Unto the David's seed

3.
Renew our days, O Lord in Thee
O when children praise Thee
Great is Thy strength and goodness Lord
As in the days of Old

- John Hopkins
