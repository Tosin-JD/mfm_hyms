Jesus, Saviour, Pilot Me

1.
Jesus, Saviour pilot me
Over life’s tempestuous sea;
Unknown waves before me roll,
Hiding rocks and treach’rous shoal;
Chart and compass come from Thee,
Jesus, Saviour, pilot me!

2.
As a mother stills her child,
Thou canst hush the ocean wild;
Boist’rous waves obey Thy will
When Thou say’st to them, “Be still!”
Wondrous Sov’reign of the sea,
Jesus, Saviour, pilot me!

3.
When at last I near the shore,
And the fearful breakers roar
‘Twixt me and the peaceful rest
Then, while leaning on Thy breast,
May I hear Thee say to me,
“Fear not, I will pilot thee!”
