St. Columba - 8.7.8.7.

1.
Here, Lord, we take the broken bread
and drink the wine, believing
that by your life our souls are fed,
your parting gifts receiving.

2.
As you have given, so we would give
ourselves for others’ healing;
as you have lived, so we would live
the Father’s love revealing.


- C. V. Pilcher
