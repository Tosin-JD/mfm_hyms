Thine, Thine For Ever Blessed Bond - C. M.

1.
Thine - thine for ever" blessed bond
That knits, us, Lord, to Thee;
May voice, and heart, and soul respond
Amen, so let it be.

2.
When this world strikes its dulcet harp,
And earth our heaven appears.
Be “Thine for ever, “clear and sharp,
God’s trumpet in our ears.

3.
When sin in pleasure’s soft disguise
Would work us deadliest harm,
May “Thine for ever” from the skies
Steal down, and break the charm.

4.
When Satan flings his fiery darts
Against our weary shield.
May “Thine for ever” in our hearts
Forbid us faint or yield.

5.
Thine all along the flowery spring,
Along the summer prime.
Till autumn fades in welcoming
The silver frost of time.

6.
'Thine, Thine for every, “body, soul.
Henceforth devote to Thee,
While everlasting ages roll:
Amen, so let it be.
