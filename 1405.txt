Rest-8.8.8.8.8.8.

1.
The saints of God, their conflict past,
And life’s long battle won at last,
No more they need the shield or sword;
They cast them down before their Lord
O happy saints! For ever blest,
At Jesu’s feet how safe their rest.

2.
The saints of God, their wanderings done,
No more their weary course they run,
No more they faint, no more they fall,
No foes oppress, no fears appal:
O happy saints! For ever blest,
In that dear home, how sweet their rest.

3.
The saints of God, life’s voyage o’er,
Safe landed on that blissful shore,
No stormy tempests now they dread,
No roaring billows lift their head:
Shappy saints! For ever blest,
In that calm haven of their rest.

4.
O God of saints, to Thee we cry;
O Saviour, plead for us on high;
O Holy Ghost, our Guide and Friend,
Grant us Thy grace till life shall end:
That with all saints our rest may be
In that bright paradise with Thee.

- William Dalrymple Maclagan
