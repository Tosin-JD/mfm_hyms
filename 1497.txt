Some Day, But When I Cannot Tell - 8.8.8.6. with Ref.

1 . 
Some day, but when I cannot tell,
To toil and tears I'll bid farewell,
For I shall with the angels dwell,
Some day, some blessed day.

CHORUS
Some day, some day
I’ll be at home with Christ to stay,
Some day, some blessed day.

2.
Some day within the gates so fair,
A golden harp my hands shall bear;
And glistening robes of white I’ll wear,
Some day some blessed day.

3.
Some day I'll see mySaviour’s face,
And, welcomed to His blest embrace,
Shall with His people find a place,
Some day, some blessed day.

3.
Some day, some blessed day, I know
I’ll find the loved of long ago,
And learn how much to Christ I owe,
Some day, some blessed day.

- Charles Walker Ray
