Who’ll Be The Next To Follow Jesus

1.
Who’ll be the next to follow Jesus?
Who’ll be the next His cross to bear?
Someone is ready, someone is waiting,
Who’ll be the next a crown to wear?

CHORUS
Who'll be the next, who’ll be the next,
Who’ll be the next to follow Jesus?
Who’ll be the next to follow Jesus now?
Follow Jesus now?

2.
Who’ll be the next to follow Jesus?
Come and bow at His precious feet.
Who’ll be the next to lay every burden
Down at The Father’s Mercy-seat?

3.
Who’ll be the next to follow Jesus?
Who’ll be the next to praise His name?
Who’ll swell the chorus of free redemption,
Sing, Hallelujah! Praise the Lamb?
