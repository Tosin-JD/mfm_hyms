Herongate - 8.8.8.8.(L.M.)

1.
Lord Jesus, let these eyes of mine
reflect your beauty and your grace;
so joyful and so tender shine
that other eyes shall seek your face.

2.
Lord, use my ears, for I rejoice
to hear the word of life with awe
I listen for the whispering voice
that calls beyond the thunderâ€™s roar.

3.
And holy Jesus, set my mind
to search for truth and find your way;
to think upon the good I find,
to spurn the night and love the day,

4.
And may my hands, which I learned their skill
at your direction, by your love,
now deftly moving at your will
console, encourage and improve.

5.
So to your throne, O Christ, again
my sense of sight and sound I bring;
and in my mind I let you reign,
and with my hands serve you, my
king.

6.
Speak through this voice that you have given,
your love and mercy to proclaim,
until we worship you in heaven
and sing the glory of your name!
