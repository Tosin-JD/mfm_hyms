Weber - 7.7.

1.
Ere another Sabbath's close,
Ere again we seek repose,
Lord, our song ascends to Thee,
At Thy feet we bow the knee.

2.
For the mercies of the day,
For this rest upon our way,
Thanks to Thee alone be given,
Lord of earth, and King of heaven.

3.
Cold our services have been,
Mingled every prayer with sin;
But Thou canst and wilt forgive,
By Thy grace alone we live.

4.
Whilst this thorny path we tread
May Thy love our footsteps lead;
When our journey here is past,
May we rest with Thee at last.

5.
Let these earthly Sabbaths prove
Foretastes of our joys above;
While their steps Thy pilgrims bend
To the rest which knows no end.
