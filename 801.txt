O, how I love Jesus - C.M. with Refrain

1.
There is a name I love to hear,
I love to sing its worth;
It sounds like music in my ear,
The sweetest name on earth.

CHORUS
O, how I love Jesus,
O, how I love Jesus,
O , how I love Jesus
Because He first loved me!

2.
It tells me of a Saviour’s love,
who died to set me free;
It tells me of His precious blood,
The sinner’s perfect plea.

3.
It tells me what my Father hath
In store for ev’ry day,
And, tho I tread a dark-some path.
Yields sunshine all the way.

4.
It tells of One whose loving heart
Can feel my deepest woe,
Who in each sorrow bears a part
That none can bear below.

- Frederick Whitfield
