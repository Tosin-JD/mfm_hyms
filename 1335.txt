A Watchman on Zion’s Wall

1.
Will you be a watch on Zion”s wall?
Warn the helpless nations far and wide;
Sound the prophet’s message long foretold;
Man’s one hope is Christ, the crucified.

CHORUS
Go and shout it from the city wall;
Herald upward, outward, far and wide:
Truth and love, the victory will win-
Build your hope in Christ, the crucified.

2.
All have sinn’d and judgement day must come;
Love has paid the debt to set men free;
Lest you warn the lost, they’ll surely die.
And their blood may be requir’d of thee.

3.
Save yourselves, proclaim the gospel way,
Free salvation thru the Christ alone;
Let God’s mighty, saving word
prevail.Soon He'll send His Son to claim " His own.
