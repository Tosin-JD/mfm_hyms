St. Bees -7.7.

1.
Sinful sighing to be blest;
Bound, and longing to be free;
Weary, waiting for my rest;
God b,e merciful to me.

2.
Goodness I have none to plead,
Sinfulness in all I see,
I can only bring my need:
God be merciful to me.

3.
Broken heart and downcast eyes
Dare not lift themselves to Thee;
Yet Thou canst interpret sighs:
God be merciful to me.

4.
From this sinful heart of mine
To Thy bosom I would flee;
I am not my own but Thine:
God be merciful to me.

5.
There is One beside the Throne,
And my only hope and plea
Are in Him, and Him alone:
God be merciful to me.

6.
He my cause will undertake.
My Interpreter will be;
He's my all; and for His sake
God be merciful to me.
