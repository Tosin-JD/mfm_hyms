Cannock - L. M.

1.
O Thou who dost direct my feet
To right or left where pathways part,
Wilt Thou not, faithful Paraclete,
Direct the journeying of my heart?

2.
Into the love of God, I pray,
Deeper and deeper let me press,
Exploring all along the way
Its secret strength and tenderness.

3.
Into the steadfastness of One
Who patiently endured the cross,
Of Him who, though He were a Son,
Came to His crown through bitter loss.

4.
This is the road of my desire
Learning to love as God loves me,
Ready to pass through flood or fire
With Christ's unwearying constancy.

- Frank Houghton
