Glory Song -10.10.10.10. with Refrain

1.
When all my labours and trials are o'er,
And I am safe on that beautiful shore,
Just to be near the dear Lord I adore
Will through the ages be glory for me.

CHORUS
0 that will be glory for me,.
Glory for me, glory for me;
When by His grace I shall look on His face.
That will be glory, be glory for me.

2.
When by the gift of His infinite grace,
0 am accorded in heavens place,
Just to be there and to look on His face
Will through the ages be glory for me.

3.
Friends will be there I have loved
long ago;Joy like a river around me will flow;
Yet, just a smile from my Saviour, I know,
Will through the ages be glory for me.

- Charles H. Gabriel
