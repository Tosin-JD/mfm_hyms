All Hail, Immanuel

1.
All hail to Thee, Immanuel,
We cast our crowns before Thee;
Let every heart obey Thy will,
And every voice adore Thee.
In praise to Thee, our Saviour King,
The vibrant chords of Heaven ring,
And echo back the mighty strain:
All hail! All hail! All hail! All hail! Immanuel!

CHORUS
Hail! (Hail to the King we love so well!)
Immanuel! Immanuel!
Hail! (Hail to the King we love so well!)
Immanuel! Immanuel!
Glory and honour and majesty,
Wisdom and power be unto Thee,
Now and ever more!
Hail! (Hail to the King we love so well!)
Immanuel! Immanuel!
Hail! (Hail to the King we love so well!)
Immanuel! Immanuel!
King of kings and Lord of Lords,
All hail, Immanuel!

2.
All hail to Thee, Immanuel,
The ransomed hosts surround Thee;
And earthly monarchs?
Their Sovereign King to crown Thee.
While those redeemed in ages gone,
Assembled round the great white throne,
Break forth into immortal song:
All hail! All hail! All hail! All hail! Immanuel!

3.
All hail to Thee, Immanuel,
Our risen King and Saviour!
Thy foes are vanquished, and
Thou art Omnipotent forever.
Death, sin and hell no longer reign,
And Satan's pow'r is burst in twain;
Eternal glory to Thy Name;
All hail! All hail! All hail! All hail! Immanuel!
