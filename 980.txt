As a Volunteer

1. A call for loyal soldiers Comes to one and all;
Soldiers for the conflict,
Will you heed the call?
Will you answer quickly? With a ready cheer?
Will you be enlisted as a volunteer?

CHORUS
A volunteer for Jesus, A soldier true!
Others have enlisted, Why not you?
Jesus is the Captain, We will never fear;
Will you be enlisted As a volunteer?

2 Yes, Jesus calls for soldiers
Who are filled with pow’r,
Soldiers who will serve Him
Ev'ry day and hour;
He will not forsake you, He is ever near;
Will you be enlisted as a volunteer?

3. He calls you, for he loves you
With a heart most kind.
He whose heart was broken,
Broken for mankind;
Now, just now He calls you,
Calls in accents clear,
Will you be enlisted as a volunteer?

4. And when the war is over, And the vict’ry won,
When the true and faithful Gather one by one,
He will crown with glory All who there appear;
Will you be enlisted as a volunteer?
