Andenken -S.M.

1.
Lord Jesus, think on me.
And purge away my sin:
From earth-born passions set me free,
And make me pure within.

2.
Lord Jesus, think on me
With many a care oppressâ€™d;
Let me Thy loving servant be,
And taste Thy promised rest.

3.
Lord Jesus, think on me,
Nor let me go astray;
Through darkness and perplexity
Point Thou the heavenly way.

4.
Lord Jesus, think on me.
That, when the flood is past,
I may the eternal brightness see,
And share Thy joy at last.
Could give the guilty conscience peace,

5.
Lord Jesus, think on me,
That I may sing above
To Father, Holy Ghost, and Thee
The songs of praise and love.-J. Bamby
