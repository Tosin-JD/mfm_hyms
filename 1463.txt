O Paradise - Irregular

1.
Oh, Paradise, oh Paradise,
Who doth not crave for rest?
Who would not seek the happy
land,
The mansions of the blest;
Where loyal hearts, and true,
Stand ever in the light,
All rapture, through and through
In God's most holy sight?

2.
Oh Paradise, oh Paradise,
The world is growing old;
Who would not be at rest and free
Where love is never cold?
Where loyal hearts, and true,
Stand ever in the light,
All rapture, through and through
In God's most holy sight?

3.
Oh Paradise, oh Paradise,
I want to sin no more,
I want to be where Jesus is
Upon thy spotless shore;
Where toyal hearts, and true,
Stand ever in the light,
All rapture, through and through
In God's most holy sight?

4.
Oh Paradise, oh Paradise,
I shall not wait for long;
E'en now the loving ear may catch
Faint fragments of thy song;
Where loyal hearts, and true,
Stand ever in the light,
All rapture, through and through
In God's most holy sight?

5.
Lord Jesus, King of Paradise
Oh keep me in Thy love,
And guide me to that happy land
Of perfect rest above;
Where loyal hearts, and true,
Stand ever in the light.
All rapture, through and through
In God's most holy sight.
