607

HE WILL GATHER THE WHEAT


1.
When Jesus shall gather the nations
Before Him at last to appear,
Oh, how shall we stand in the Judgement,
When summon’d our sentence to hear?

CHORUS
He will gather the wheat in His gamer,
But the chaff will He scatter away;
Then how shall we stand in the Judgement
Oh, how shall we stand in that day?

2.
Shall we hear from the lips of the Saviour
The words, “Faithful servant, well
done!”Or, trembling with fear and with anguish,
Be banish’d away from His throne?

3.
Then let us be watching and waiting
Our lamps burning steady and bright
That when we are call’d by the Bridegroom,
We’ll answer the call with delight.

4.
Thus living with hearts fixed on Jesus,
In patience we wait for the time
When, the days of our pilgrimage ended,
We’ll rest in His presence Divine.
