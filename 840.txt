In Times Like These You Need A Saviour -7.6.7.6.

1.
In times like these you need a Saviour
In times like these you need an anchor.
Be very sure Be very sure,
Your anchor holds and grips the Solid Rock!

CHORUS
This Rock is Jesus, Yes He's the One,
This Rock is Jesus, the only One;
Be very sure, be very sure,
Your anchor holds and grips the Solid Rock!

2.
In times like these you need the Bible,
In times like these, O, be not idle
Be very sure, be very sure.
Your anchor holds and grips the Solid Rock!

3.
In times like these I have a Saviour,
In times like these, I have an anchor.
I’m very sure, I’m very sure,
My anchor holds and grips the Solid Rock!
