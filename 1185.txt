Elberton -10.10.

1.
Draw nigh and take the Body of the Lord,
And drink the holy Blood for you outpoured.

2.
Saved by that Body and that holy Blood,
With souls refreshed, we render thanks to God.

3.
Salvationâ€™s giver, Christ the only Son,
By his dear Cross and Blood the victory won.

4.
Offered was he for greatest and for least,
Himself the Victim, and himself the Priest.

5.
Victims were offered by the law of old,
Which in a type this heavenly mystery told.

6.
He, Lord of life, and Saviour of our race,
Hath given the safeguard of salvation here.

7.
Approach ye then with faithful hearts sincere,
And take the safeguard of salvation here.

8.
He that his saints in this world rules and shields
To all believers life eternal yields;

9.
He feeds the hungry with the Bread of heaven,
And living streams to those who thirst are given.

10.
Alpha and Omega, to whom shall bow
All nations at the Doom, is with us now.
