Olivet-66.4.6.6.6.4.

1 My faith looks up to Thee,
Thou Lamb of Calvary,
Saviour divine!
Now hear me while I pray,
Take all my guilt away,
O let me from this day
Be wholly Thine!

2.
May Thy rich grace impart
Strength to my fainting heart,
My zeal inspire;
As Thou hast died for me,
0 may my love to Thee
Pure, warm, and changeless be,
A living fire!

3.
While life's dark maze I tread
And griefs around me spread,
Be Thou my guide;Bid darkness turn to day,
Wipe sorrow’s tears away,
Nor let me ever stray From Thee aside.

4.
When ends life’s passing dream,
When death’s cold, threatening Stream
Shall o’er me roll,
Blest Saviour, then, in love.
Fear and distrust remove;
O lift me safe above, A ransomed soul!
