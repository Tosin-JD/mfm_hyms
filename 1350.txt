Brunswick - 8.6.8.6.8.6.

1.
Dismiss me not from thy service, Lord,
But train me for thy will;
For even I, in field so broad,
Some duties may fulfil;
And I will ask for no reward.
Except to serve thee still.

2.
All works are good, and each is best
As most it pleases thee;
Each worker pleases, when the rest
He serves in charity ,
And neither man nor work unblest
Wilt thou permit to be.

3.
Our Master all the work hath done
He asks of us today;
Sharing his service, every one
Share too his sonship may:
Lord, I would serve and be a son;
Dismiss me not, I pray.

- G. F. Bradby
