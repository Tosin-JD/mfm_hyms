Abiding

1.
Abiding, oh, so wondrous sweet!
I'm resting at the Saviour’s feet,
I trust in Him, I'm satisfied,
I'm resting in the Crucified!

CHORUS
Abiding, abiding,
Oh, so wondrous sweet!
I’m resting, resting
At the Saviour’s feet.

2.
He speaks, and by His word is giv’n
His peace, a rich foretaste of heav’n!
Not as the world He peace doth give,
‘Tis thro’ this hope my soul shall live.

3.
I live; not I; through Him alone
By Whom the mighty work is done,
Dead to myself, alive to Him,
I count all loss His rest to gain.

4.
Now rest, my heart, the work is done,
I'm saved through the Eternal Son!
Let all my powers my soul employ,
To tell the world my peace and joy.
