Hyfrydol - 8.7.8.7.D.

1.
Jesus! what a Friend sinners!
Jesus! Lover of my soul;
Friends may fail me, foes assail me.
He, my Saviour, makes me whole.

2.
Jesus! what a Strength in weakness!
Let me hide myself in Him;
Tempted, tried, and sometimes failing,
He, my Strength, my vict'ry wins.

3.
Jesus! what a Help in sorrow!
While the billows oâ€™er me roll.
Even when my heart is breaking,
He, my Comfort, helps my soul.

4.
Jesus! what a Guide and Keeper!
While the tempest still is high,
Storms about me, night o'er takes me.
He, my Pilot, hears my cry.

5.
Jesus! I do now receive Him,
More than all in Him I find.
He hath granted me forgiveness,
I am His, and He is mine.
