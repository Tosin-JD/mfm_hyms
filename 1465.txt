After This Dismal And Dark World - C. M.

1.
After this dismal and dark world
Eternal glory waits
A country of eternal joy
No mortal eye hath seen.

2.
Our eyes long to see half Thy joy
Beautiful city, bright.
How our hearts would have wished
to leave
This world, the vale of tears.

3.
No night in those fair cities bright
It is perpetual day
For sin, the source of all the curse
Will not enter therein.

4.
May this cherished hope of heaven
Set all our hearts aflame
Grant to us that this faith and love
Lift high our thoughts to God.

5.
O Lord, in mercy, make us meet
For Thy bright courts above,
And grant that our hearts may prepare
To join the heavenly throng.
