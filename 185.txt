God rest you merry, Gentlemen - 8.6.8.6.8.6. with Refrain

1.
God rest you merry, gentlemen.
Let nothing you dismay,
For Jesus Christ our Saviour
Was born upon this day ;
To save us all from Satan's power
When we were gone astray.

CHORUS
O tidings of comfort and joy!
Comfort and joy!
O tidings of comfort and joy!

2.
In Bethlehem in Jewry
This blessed babe was born.
And laid within a manger
Upon this blessed morn;
The which His mother Mary
Did nothing take in scorn.

3.
From God our heavenly Father
A blessed angel came,
And unto certain shepherds
Brought tidings of the same,
How that in Bethlehem was born
The Son of God by name.

4.
'Fear not,’then said the angel,
‘Let nothing you affright,
This day is born a Saviour
Of a pure virgin bright,
To free all those who trust in Him
From Satan's power and might.

5.
The shepherds at those tidings
Rejoiced much in mind.
And left their flocks a feeding
In tempest, storm and wind,
And went to Bethlehem straightway.
This blessed babe to find.

6.
And when to Bethlehem they came,
Whereat this infant lay,
They found Him in a manger
Where oxen feed on hay;
His mother Mary kneeling
Unto the Lord did pray.

7.
Now to the Lord sing praises,
All you within this place.
And with true love and brotherhood
Each other now embrace,
This holy tide of Christmas
All anger should efface.
