I Am Resolved

1.
lam resolved no longer to linger,
Charmed by the world’s delight;
Things that are higher, things that are nobler,
These have allured my sight.

CHORUS
I will hasten to Him,
Hasten so glad and free,
Jesus, greatest, highest,
I will come to Thee.

2.
I am resolved to go to the Saviour,
Leaving my sin and strife;
He is the true one, He is the just one,
He hath the words of life.

3.
I am resolved to follow the Saviour,
Faithful and true each day;
Heed what He sayeth, do what He willeth,
He is the living way.

4.
l am resolved to enter the Kingdom,
Leaving the paths of sin;
Friend may oppose me, foes may beset me,
Still will I enter in.

5.
I am resolved, and who will go with me?
Come, friends, without delay;
Taught by the Bible, led by the Spirit,
We’ll walk the heavenly way.
