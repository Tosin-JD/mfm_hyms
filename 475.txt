Wonderful Saviour

1.
There is a story covered with glory
That I would tell to you.
Song of the angels, heavens angels
To the believers true.
Jesus was given, coming from heaven,
Message of love divine;
He, the oblation, offers salvation
Unto your soul and mine.

CHORUS
Wonderful, beautiful, merciful, bountiful
Is the Friend divine,
Tenderly, lovingly, wondrously, masterly,
Saves this soul of mine;
Have no fear, He is near, all the way, night and day.
Caring for His own;
Hear the call, unto all, turn from wrong, join the song
That redemption makes known.

2.
Unto each nation all of creation,
Let us toll this great news,
Sounding His glory, echo the story,
So that none need refuse.
Trusting in Jesus, quickly He frees us,
Healing our souls from sin;
With Him abiding, in Him confiding,
Glorious life we win.

3.
Jesus the Saviour, grants us His favour,
Gift of God's love divine;
With past hidden, sin is forbidden,
If we on Him recline.
Living the story, giving Him glory,
Rapture brings on the way;
Hear and believe it, truly receive it,
Make Him your Lord today.
