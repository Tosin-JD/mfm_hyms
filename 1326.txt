Amesbury - C.M.D.

1.
O Master Workman of the race,
Thou Man of Galilee,
Who, with the eyes of early youth.
Eternal things didst see;
We thank Thee for Thy boyhood faith
That shone Thy whole life through:
“Did ye not know it is My work
My Father’s work to do?”

2.
O carpenter of Nazareth,
Builder of life divine,
Who shapest man to God’s own law,
Thyself the fair design,
Build us a tow'r of Christ-like height,
That we the land may view,
And see, like Thee, our noblest work.
Our Father’s work to do.

3.
O Thou who dost the^vision send,
And givest each his ta^, '
And with the task sufficient strength:
Show us Thy will, we ask;
Give us a conscience bold and gold;
Give us a purpose true,
That it may be our highest joy
Our Father’s work to do.
