St. Patrick -7.7.D.

1.
He is gone, (or) A cloud of light
Has received Him from our sight;
High in heaven, where eye of men
Follows not, nor angel’s ken;
Through the veils of time and space,
Pass’d into the holiest place;
All the toil, the sorrow done,
All the battle fought and won.

2.
He is gone. And we remain
In this world of sin and pain:
In the void which He has left
On this earth, of Him bereft,
We have still His work to do, .
We can still His path pursue;
Seek Him both in friend and foe,
In ourselves His image show.

3.
He is gone (or) We heard Him say,
“Good that I should go away.”
Gone is that dear form and face,
But not gone His present grace;
Though Himself no more we see,
Comfortless we cannot be:
No, His Spirit still is ours,
Quickening, freshing all our powers.

4.
He is gone, (or) Towards the goal
World and church must onward roll:
Far behind we leave the past;
Forward are our glances cast:
Still His words before us range
Through the ages, as they change:
Wheresoe’er the truth shall lead,
He will give whate’er we need,

5.
He is gone, (or) But we once more
Shall behold Him as before;
In the heaven of heavens the same,
As on earth He went and came.
In the many mansions there,
Place for us He will prepare:
In that world unseen, unknown,
He and we may yet be one.

6.
He is gone, (or) But not in vain,
Wait until He comes again:
He is risen, He is not here,
Far above this earthly sphere;
Evermore in heart and mind
Where our peace in Him we find,
To our own eternal Friend,
Thitherward let us ascend.
