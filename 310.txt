Trust - L. M.

1.
He tells me to trust and not fear.
He bids me each promise believe:
His presence and glory seems near.
I open my heart to receive:
I am ransom’d, I know, 
For His Word tells me so,
So I trust, trust, trust!
I am ransom’d, I know, 
For His Word tells me so,
So I trust, trust, trust!

2.
My need He is pledged to supply,
I trust for each breath that I breathe:
And since I take life a' His hands,
Why not all He wishes to give?
Lord, I yield evermore,
For Thy promise is sure, 
So I trust, trust, trust!
Lord, I yield evermore, 
For Thy promise is sure,
So I trust, trust, trust!

3.
He offers me pardon and peace,
He offers me cleansing from sin;
The fountain once open’d I see,
Dear Jesus, I dare to plunge in:
Now I know I am free, 
For Thy blood cleanseth me,
While I trust, trust, trust!
Now I know I am free,
For Thy blood cleanseth me,
While I trust, trust, trust!

4.
Praise God, it is done I am His!
The blood covers body and soul;
I am pardon'd and cleans’d, I am heal’d;
All glory, I’m ev’ry whit whole!
Praise His name, I believe,
And this moment receive,
While I trust, trust, trust!
Praise His name, I believe. 
And this moment receive,
While I trust, trust, trust!
