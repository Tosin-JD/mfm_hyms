St. Anatolian -7.6.7.6.8.8.

1.

The day is past and over;
All thanks, O Lord, to thee;
I pray thee now that sinless
The hours of dark may be:
O Jesus, keep me in thy sight,
And guard me through the coming night.

2.

The joys of day are over;
I lift my heart to thee,
And ask thee that offence less
The hours of dark may be:
O Jesus, keep me in thy sight,
And guard me through the coming night.

3.

The toils of day are over;
I raise the hymn to thee,
And ask that free from peril
The hours of dark may be:
O Jesu, keep in thy sight,
And guard me through the coming night.

4.

Be thou my soul's preserver,
For thou alone dost know
How many are the perils
Through which I have to go:
O loving Jesu, hear my call,
And guard and save me from them all.
