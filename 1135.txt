The God to whom I pray

1.
The God who led His people thro’ the parted sea.
And from Egyptian bondage, set His children free.
Who rain’d down bread from heaven all the pilgrim way.
Is the God to whom I pray.

CHORUS
Just the same today, just the same today.
As when He led His people thro the sea;
His trustful child I’ll be. For in His word I see,
The God who doeth wonders Is just the same today

2.
The God who rescued Daniel from
the lions’ den,
And from the fiery furnace, sav’d
the three young men,
Who speaks, and constellations will
His voice obey,
Is the God to whom I pray.

3.
The God who stills the tempest with a word divine.
And on the clouds of sorrow, makes His rainbows shine,
Who from the tomb of Jesus rolled the stone away.
Is the God to whom I pray.

4.
The God who clothes the lily in Its robe of snow,
Who in the barren desert makes His rivers flow;
The God who lifts the sinner from the miry clay,
Is the God to whom I pray.
