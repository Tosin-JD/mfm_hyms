336
Springs Of Living Water

1.
I thirsted in the barren land of sin and shame,
And nothing satisfying there I  found;
But to the blessed cross of Christ one day I came,
Where springs of living water did abound.

CHORUS
Drinking at the springs of living water.
Happy now am I, My soul they satisfy;
Drinking at the springs of living water,
0 wonderful and bountiful supply.

2.
How sweet the living water from the hills of God,
It makes me glad and happy all the way;
Now glory, grace and blessing mark the path I’ve trod,
I’m shouting “Hallelujah” ev’ry day.

3.
O sinner, won’t you come today to Calvary,
A fountain there is flowing deep and wide;
The Saviour now invites you to the water free,
Where thirsting spirits can be satisfied.
