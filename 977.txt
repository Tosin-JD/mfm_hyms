Victory-D.S.M.


1.
Hark, how the watchmen cry!
Attend the trumpet’s sound!
Stand to your arms, the foe is nigh,
The powers of hell surround:
Who bow to Christ’s command,
Your arms and hearts prepare!
The day of battle is at hand!
Go forth to glorious war!

2.
Go up with Christ your Head,
Your Captain’s footsteps see;
Follow your Captian, and be led
To certain victory.
All power to Him is given,
He ever reigns the same;
Salvation, happiness, and heaven
Are all in Jesu’s name.

3.
Jesus tremendous name
Puts all our foes to flight:
Jesus, the meek, the angry Lamb.
A Lion is in fight.
By all hell’s host withstood,
We all hell's host o’erthrow;
And conquering them, through Jesu’s blood
We still to conquer go.

4.
Our Captain leads us on;
He beckons from the skies,
And reaches out a starry crown,
And bids us take the prize:
Be faithful unto death,
Partake My victory;
And thou shalt wear this glorious wreath,
And thou shalt reign with Me!

- Charles Wesley
