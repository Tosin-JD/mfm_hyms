It Is Glory Just to Walk with Him

1.
It is glory just to walk with
Him whose blood ransomed me,
It is rapture for my soul each day;
It is joy divine to feel Him
near where e’er my path may be,
Bless the Lord, it's glory all the way!

CHORUS
It is glory just to walk with Him,
It is glory just to walk with Him;
He will guide my steps aright
Thru the vale and o'er the height;
It's glory just to walk with Him.

2.
It is glory when the shadows fall to
know that He is near,
O what joy to simply trust and pray!
It is glory to abide in Him
when skies above are clear,
Yes, with Him it's glory all the way!

3.
Twill be glory when I walk with
Him on heaven’s golden shore.
Never from His side again stray;
‘Twill be glory, wondrous glory
with Saviour evermore,
Everlasting glory all the way!
