‘Tis the Blessed Hour of Prayer

1.
Tis the blessed hour of prayer,
when our hearts lowly bend,
And we gather to Jesus,
our Saviour and Friend;
If we come to Him in faith,
His protection to share,
What a balm for the weary!
Oh, how sweet to be there!

CHORUS
Blessed hour of prayer.
Blessed hour of prayer,
What a balm for the weary!
Oh, how sweet to be there!

2.
‘Tis the blessed hour of prayer,
when the Saviour draws near,
With a tender compassion,
His children to hear;
When He tells us we may cast
at His feet every care,
What a balm for the weary!
Oh, how sweet to be there!

3.
Tis the blessed hour of prayer,
when the tempted and tried
To the Saviour who loves them
their sorrow confide;
With a sympathizing heart
He removes every care;
What a balm for the weary!
Oh, how sweet to be there!

4.
At the blessed hour of prayer,
trusting Him we believe
That the blessings we're needing
we'll surely receive;
In the fullness of this trust
we shall lose ev’ry care;
What a balm for the weary!
Oh, how sweet to be there!
