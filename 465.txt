St. Cross - L.M.

1.
Oh come and mourn with me awhile;
Oh come ye to the Saviour's side;
Oh come, together let us mourn;
Jesus, our Lord, is crucified

2.
Have we no tears to shed for Him,
While soldiers scoff and Jews deride?
Ah! look patiently He hangs;
Jesus, our Lord, is crucified.

3.
Seven times He spake, seven words of love:
And all three hours His silence cried
For mercy on the souls of men;
Jesus, our Lord, is crucified

4.
Oh break, oh break, hard heart of mine!
Thy weak self-love and guilty pride
Betrayed condemned, and scourged Thy Lord,
Jesus, our Lord, is crucified.

5.
A broken heart, a fount of tears,
Ask, and they will not be denied;
Lord Jesus, may we love and weep:
Since Thou for us art crucified.

6.
O love of God, O sin of man.
In this dread act your strength is tried;
And victory remains with love;
For love Himself was crucified.
