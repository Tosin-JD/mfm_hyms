WE WILL WATCH AND WAIT

1.
There’s a light that is shining in darkness,
While we wait for the dawning of day;
And it cheers us along on our journey,
Till the shadows shall vanish away!

CHORUS
So we’ll wait and watch for the dawning,
The day of eternity blest;
Then take the wings of the morning,
And fly away to our rest.

2.
From the sure word the prophets have spoken,
There is light flashing forth thro’ the
gloom;For the Scripture can never be broken,
And the King in His glory will come.

3.
Now we sing ‘mid the darkness and shadows,
And we pray and we watch for the dawn;
Till the Daystar, in glory arising,
Shall be token the coming of morn.

4.
We are not of the night nor of darkness,
Let us walk, then, as children of day;
Our weeping shall be for a moment,
And our joy shall ne’er vanish away!
