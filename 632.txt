SOON WILL OUR SAVIOUR FROM HEAVEN APPEARD


1.
Soon will our Saviour from heaven appear,
Sweet is the hope and its power to cheer;
All will be changed by a glimpse of His face
This is the goal at the end of our race.

CHORUS
Oh, what a change! Oh, what a change
When I shall see His wonderful face!
Oh, what a change! Oh, what a
changeWhen I shall see His face!

2.
Loneliness changed to reunion complete,
Absence exchanged for a place at His feet,
Sleeping ones raised in a moment of time,
Living one changed to His image sublime.

3.
Sunrise will chase all the darkness away,
Night will be changed to the brightness of day
Tempests will be changed to ineffable calm,
Weeping will change to a jubilant psalm.

4.
Weakness will change to magnificent strength,
Failure will change to perfection at length,
Sorrow will change to unending delight,
Walking by faith change to walking by sight.
