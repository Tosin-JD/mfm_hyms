We Lift Up Our Eyes To Thee - 7.7.7.7.

1.
We lift up our eyes to Thee
And our hands and all our hearts,
Lord accept the prayer we make,
Though unworthy, weak and faint.

2.
Lord grant that we may know Thee,
May we all know Thy name,
Help us here to do Thy will,
As is done up there in heaven.

3.
When we sleep, at dead of night,
Guard us, keep and stand by us,
And when breaks forth morning light,
Let us wake, and praise Thy name.
