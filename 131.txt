Just As I Am, Without One Plea

1.
Just as I am, without one plea „
But that Thy blood was shed for me.
And that Thou bidd’st me come to Thee,
O Lamb of God, I come!

2.
Just as I am, and waiting not
To rid my soul of one dark blot,
To Thee, whose blood can cleanse each spot,
0 Lamb of God, I come!
