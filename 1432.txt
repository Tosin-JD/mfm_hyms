No Stranger There

1.
When the pearly gates are open’d
To a sinner sav’d be grace,
When thro’ everlasting mercy,
I behold my Saviour's face,
When I enter in the mansions
Of the city bright and fair,
I shall have a royal welcome,
For I'll be no stranger there.

CHORUS
I shall be no stranger there,
Jesus will my place prepare;
He will meet me. He will greet me,
I shall be no stranger there.

2.
Thro' time’s ever changing seasons,
I am pressing t’ward the goaJ;
‘Tis my heart's sweet native country,
Tis the homeland of my soul;
Many lov’d ones, cloth’d with beauty,
In those wondrous glories share;
When I rise, redeemed, forgiven,
I shall be no stranger there.

3.
There my dear Redeemer liveth,
Blessed Lamb upon the throne;
By the crimson marks upon them,
He will surely claim His own.
So, whenever sad or lonely,
Look beyond the earthly care;
Weary child of God, remember,
You will be no stranger there.
