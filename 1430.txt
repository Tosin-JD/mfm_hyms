Beulah - D.C.M.

1.
Jerusalem, my happy home,
Name ever dear to me!
When shall my labours have an end.
In joy, and peace, and thee?
When shall these eyes thy heav’n built walls
And pearly gates behold,
Thy bulwarks with salvation strong.
And streets of shining gold?

2.
There happier bowers then Eden’s bloom,
Nor sin nor sorrow know:
Blest seats, through rude and stormy scenes
I onward press to you.
Why should I shrink at pain and woe,
Or feel, at death, dismay?
I’ve Canaan’s goodly land in view,
And realms of endless day.

3.
Apostles, prophets, martyrs there
Around my Saviour stand;
And soon my friends in Christ below
Will join the glorious band.
Jerusalem, my happy home.
My soul still pants for thee!
Then shall my labours have an end,
When I thy joys shall see.

- Joseph Bromehead
