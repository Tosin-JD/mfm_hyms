Nearer Home - D.S.M.

1.
For ever with the Lord!
Amen, so let it be!
Life from the dead is in that word;
'Tis immortality.
Here in the body bent,
Absent from Him I roam;
Yet nightly pitch my moving tent
A day’s march nearer home.

2.
My Father's house on high,
Home of my soul, how near
At times to faith's foreseeing eye
Thy golden gates appear!
My thirsty spirit faints
To reach the land I love,
The bright inheritance of saints
Jerusalem above.

3.
For ever with the Lord!
Father, if ‘tis Thy will,
The promise of that faithful word,
E’en here to me fulfil.
Be Thou at my right hand,
Then can I never fail;
Uphold Thou me, so I shall stand,
Fight, and I must prevail.

4.
So when my latest breath
Shall rend the veil in twain,
By death I shall escape from death,
And life eternal gain.
Knowing as I am known,
How shall I love that word!
And oft repeat before the throne.
For ever with the Lord!
