St. Leonard - C.M.

1.
Lord, I would own Thy tender care.
And all Thy love to me:
The food I eat, the clothes I wear.
Are all bestowed by Thee.

2.
â€˜Tis Thou preservest me from death
And dangers every hour:
I cannot draw another breath
Unless Thou give me power.

3.
My health and friends and parents dear
To me by God are given;
I have not any blessing here
But what is sent from heaven.

4.
Kind angels guard me every night,
As round my bed they stay;
Nor am I absent from Thy sight
In darkness or by day.

5.
Such goodness, Lord, and constant care,
I never can repay:
But may it be my daily prayer,
To love Thee and obey.
