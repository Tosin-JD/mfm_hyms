There’s A Place I Love To Tarry - 8.7.8.7.with Ref.

1. There’s a place I love to tarry
When my soul is sad, oppressed,
“Tis alone with Christ my Saviour
Where He bids me “Come and rest”

CHORUS
Just to be alone with Jesus
Just to hear Him softly say:
“Fear not, though the world forsake you,
“Lo I'm with you always.”

2. When the cares of life heavy.
And beneath my cross I bend:
Then I go alone with Jesus.
For He is my dearest Friend.

3. When the tempter would assail me,
Jesus bids me to Him flee;
He’s my Refuge, Friend and Saviour,
He is all in all to me.
