â€”ACCEPTANCE AND REPENTANCE

3.
Just as I am, though tossed about
With many a conflict, many a doubt,
Fighting and fears within, without,
O Lamb of God, I come!

4.
Just as I am, poor, wretched, blind;
Sight, riches, healing of the mind,
Yea, all I need, in Thee to find,
O Lamb of God, I come!

5.
Just as I am, Thou wilt receive,
Wilt welcome, pardon, cleanse,relieve;
Because Thy promise I believe,
O Lamb of God, I come!

6.
Just as I am-Thy love unknown
Has broken every barrier down
Now to be Thine, yea Thine alone,
O Lamb of God, I come.
