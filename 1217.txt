Irene - 8.6.8.4.

1.
Rest in the Lord from harps above
The music seems to thrill
Rest in His everlasting love,
Rest and be still

2.
Rest thou, who claimest for thine own
Thy chosen bride today,
Affianced in His faith alone
Thy bride for aye.

3.
And thou, whose trustful hand is given
Avouching here thy spouse.
Rest, for a Father seals in heaven
His childrenâ€™s vows.

4.
Rest ye, who cluster round them both
To mingle praise and prayers;
Your God affirms the plighted troth,Your God and theirs.

5.
Rest, for the Heavenly Bridgeroom 
here Is standing by your side,
And in this union draws more near His mystic bride.

6.
Rest in the Lord thrice Holy Dove,
In us Thy word fulfil
Rest in His everlasting love,
Rest and be still.
