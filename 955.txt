Soldiers of Immanuel

1.
Soldiers of Jesus! soldiers of the Cross!
Follow your Captain, counting all but loss;
If you fight the battle you shall gain renown,
And if you are faithful you shall wear a crown.

CHORUS
(verses 1 -4)
March on! March on! soldiers of Immanuel;
March on! March on! singing as wego:
Glory! glory to the Lamb of Calvary!
In His might we conquer ev’ry foe.

2.
Soldiers of Jesus! gird ye to the fray,
Stand in your armour in this evil day,
Where the battle rages there may ye be found.
Where the need is greatest that is holy ground.

3.
Soldiers of Jesus! lift your standard high;
Write on your banners: Jesus came to die;
By the Cross of Jesus we the vict'ry win,
For the blood of Jesus cleanseth from all sin.

4.
Soldiers of Jesus! when the battle’s done.
Foes all are vanquish’d, and the vict’ry won;
Then with shouts of triumph we shall hail the King,
When the vaults of heaven with His praises ring.

5.
Soldiers of Jesus! of the Lamb once slain,
Know ye that Jesus soon will come to reign;
Lift your heads in gladness, victory is nigh,
Send a shout of welcome through the earth and sky.

CHORUS 
(verse 5 only)
Come, Lord, Jesus! come and take Thy people home;
Come, O come! we long Thy face to see;
Come, Lord Jesus! claim the kingdom and the pow’r,
Set the earth from all its bondage free.
