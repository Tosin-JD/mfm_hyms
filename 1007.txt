O GOD OF BETHEL, BY WHOSE HAND

1.
O God of Bethel, by whose hand
Thy people still are fed.
Who through this weary pilgrimage
Hast all our fathers led;

2.
Our vows, our prayers, we now present
Before thy throne of grace;
God of our fathers, be the God
Of their succeeding race.

3.
Through each perplexing path of life
Our wandering footsteps guide;
Give us each day our daily bread;
And raiment fit provide.

4.
O spread thy covering wings around,
Till all our wanderings cease,
And at our Fatherâ€™s love abode
Our souls arrive in peace.
