Dolgelly - 6.6.6.6.8.8.

1.
Thou, Lord, hast power to heal,
And thou wilt quickly aid.
For thou dost deeply feel
The stripes upon us laid:
Thou who wast wounded by the rod
Uplifted in the hand of God.

2.
Send speedy help, we pray,
To him who ailing lies,
That from his couch he may
With thankful heart arise;
Through prayers which all availing find
Thine ear, O Lover of mankind

3.
O blinded are our eyes,
And all are held in night;
But like the blind who cries,
We cry to thee for light;
In penitence, O Christ, we pray,
Give us the radiant light of day.

- J.B.
