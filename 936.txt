1.
Christian soldiers, onward qo!
Jesusâ€™ triumph you shall know;
fight the fight, maintain the strife,
strengthened with the bread of life

2.
Join the war and face the foe:
Christian soldiers, onward go;
boldly stand in danger's hour,
trust your captain, prove his power

3.
Let your drooping hearts be glad,
march in heavenly armour clad;
fight, nor think the battle long
soon shall victory be your song.

4.
Sorrow must not dim your eye.
soon shall every tear be dry;
banish fear, you shall succeed
great your strength if great your need.

5.
Onward, then, in battle move!
more than conquerors you shall prove;
though opposed by many a foe
Christian soldiers, onward go!
