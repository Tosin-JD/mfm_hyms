1.
Go, labour on, spend, and be spent,
Thy joy to do the Father’s will;
It is the way the Master went,
Should not the servant tread it still?

2.
Go, labour on: ‘tis not for nought,
Thy earthly loss is heav’nly gain;
Men heed thee, love thee, praise
thee not,
The Master praises what are men!

3.
Men died in darkness at your side
Without a hope to cheer the tomb;
Take up the torch and wave it wide,
The torch that lights time’s thickest
gloom.

4.
Toil on, and in thy toil rejoice,
For toil comes r est, for exile home;
Soon shalt thou hear the
Bridegroom’s voice,
The midnigh’t peal, ‘Behold, I come!’

- Horatius Bonar
