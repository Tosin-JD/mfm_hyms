Pentecostal Power

1.
Lord, as of the old at Pentecost
Thou didst Thy pow’r display,
With cleansing, purifying flame
Descend on us today.

CHORUS
Lord, send the old time pow’r,
the Pentecostal pow’r!
Thy flood gates of blessing
on us throw open wide! Lord,
send the old time pow’r,
the Pentecostal pow’r,
That sinners be Converted and
Thy name glorified!

2.
For mighty works for Thee prepare,
And strengthen ev’ry heart;
Each waiting heart to work for Thee;
O Lord, our faith renew!

3.
All self consume, all sin destroy!
With earnest zeal endue
Each waiting heart to work for Thee;
O Lord, our faith renew!

4.
Speak, Lord! before Thy throne we wait,
Thy promise we believe,
And will not let Thee go until
The blessing we receive!
