Leoni -6.6.8.4.D.


1.

The battle is the Lord’s!
The harvest fields are white:
How few the reaping hands appear,
Their strength how slight!
Yet victory is sure We face a vanquished foe;
Then forward with the risen Christ To battle go!

2.
The battle is the Lord’s!
Not ours in strength or skill,
But His alone, in sovereign grace,
To work His will.
Ours, counting not the cost,
Unflinching, to obey;
And in His time His holy arm Shall
win the day.

3.
The battle is the Lord’s!
The Victor crucified
Must with the travail of His soul Be satisfied.
The pow’rs of hell shall fail,
And all God’s will be done,
Till every soul whom He has giv’n
To Christ be won.

4.
The battle is the Lord's! Stand still
my soul, and view
The great salvation God has
wrought Revealed for you.
Then, resting in His might, Lift high
His triumph song,
For pow’r, dominion, kingdom,
strength To Christ belong!
