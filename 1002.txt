MY SOUL BE ON THY GUARD

1.
My soul be on thy guard;
Ten thousand foes arise,
And hosts of sin are pressing hard
To draw thee from the skies.

2.
Oh, watch and fight and pray,
The battle ne'er give o’er;
Renew it boldly ev'ry day
And help divine implore.

3.
Ne'er think the vict’ry won
Nor lay thine armour down;
Thine arduous work will not be done
HI thou obtain thy crown.

4.
Fight on, my soul, till death
Shall bring thee to thy God;
He’ll take thee at thy parting breath
To His divine abode
