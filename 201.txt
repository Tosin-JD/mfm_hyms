Quern Pastores Laudavere - 8.8.8.6.

1.
Shepherds came, their praises bringing,
who had heard the angels singing:
â€˜Far from you be fear unruly,
Christ is king of glory born.'

2.
Wise men whom a star had guided
incense, gold, and myrrh provided,
made their sacrifices truly
to the King of glory born.

3.
Jesus born the King of heaven,
Christ to us through Mary given,
to your praise and honour duly
be resounding glory done.

- G. B. Caird
