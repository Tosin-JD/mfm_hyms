Storm the forts

1.
Soldiers of our God, arise!
The day is drawing nearer;
Shake the slumber from your eyes,
The light is growing clearer.
Sit no longer idly by,
While the heedless millions die,
Lift the Blood stained banner high,
And take the field for Jesus.

CHORUS
Storm the forts of darkness,
Bring them down, bring them down!
Storm the forts of darkness,
Bring them down, bring them down!
Pull down the Devil’s kingdom,
Where’er he holds dominion,
Storm the forts of darkness,bring them down!
Glory, honour to the Lamb,
Praise and power to the Lamb;
Glory, honour, praise and power,
Before ever to the Lamb!

2.
See the brazen hosts of Hell,
Art and power employing,
More than human tongue can tell,
Blood bought souls destroying.
Hark! from ruin’s ghastly road,
Victims groan beneath their load;
Forward, O ye sons of God,
And dare or die for Jesus.

3
Warriors of the Bleeding Lamb,
Army of Salvation,
Spread the fame of Gilead’s balm,
Conquer every nation.
Raise the glorious Standard higher,
Strike for victory never tire;
Forward march with Blood and Fire,
And win the world for Jesus.

- Robert Johnson (1884)
