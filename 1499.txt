We Speak Of The Land Of The Blest -8.9.8.8.

1.
We speak of the land of the Blest.
Of that country so bright so fair;
And oft are its glories confessed;
But what must it be to be there?

2.
We speak of its pathways of gold.
Of its walls decked with jewels most rare,
Its wonders and pleasures untold;
But what must it be to be there?

3.
We speak of its freedom from sin,
From sorrow, temptation, and care,
From trials without and within;
But what must it be to be there.

4.
We speak of its anthems of praise,
With which we can never compare,
The sweetest on earth we can raise,
But what must it be to be there.

5.
We speak of its service of love
Of the robes which the glorified wear,
The Church of the First-born above;
But what must it be to be there.

6.
Do Thou, Lord,'midst pleasure of woe,
Still for Heaven our spirits prepare;
And shortly we also shall know.
And feel what it is to be there.

- Mrs. Elizabeth Mills 1805 â€“ 1829
