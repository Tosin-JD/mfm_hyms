It’s Just Like His Great Love

1.
A Friend I have called Jesus,
Whose love is strong and true,
And never fails howe’er 'tis tried,
No matter what I do;
I've sinned against this love of His,
But when I knelt to pray.
Confessing all my guilt to Him,
The sin clouds rolled away.

CHORUS
It's just like Jesus to roll the clouds away,
It’s just like Jesus to keep me day by day,
It's just like Jesus all along the way,
It’s just like His great love.

2.
Sometimes the clouds of trouble
Be dim the sky above,
I cannot see my Saviour’s face,
I doubt His wondrous love;
But He, from Heaven’s mercy seat.
Beholding my despair,
In pity bursts the clouds between,
And shows me He is there.

3.
When sorrow’s clouds o’ertake me,
And break upon my head,
When life seems worse than useless.
And I were better dead;
I take my grief to Jesus then,
Nor do I go in vain.
For heav'nly hope He gives that cheers
Like sunshine after rain.
