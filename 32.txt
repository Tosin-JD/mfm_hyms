Unser Herrsher - 8.7.8.7.8.7.

1.
Alleluia! raise the anthem,
let the skies resound with praise;
sing to Christ who brought salvation,
wonderful his works and ways:
God eternal, Word incarnate,
whom the heaven of heavens obeys.

2.
Long before he formed the mountains,
spread the seas or made the sky,
love eternal, free and boundless,
moved the Lord of life to die;
fore-ordained the Prince of princes
for the throne of Calvary.

3.
There for us and our redemption
see him all his life-blood pour;
there he wins our full salvation,
dies that we may die no more
then arising lives forever,
King of kings, whom we adore.

4.
Praise and honour to the Father,
praise and honour to the Son,
praise and honour to the Spirit,
ever three and ever one:
one in grace and one in glory
while eternal ages run!

- J. Hupton
