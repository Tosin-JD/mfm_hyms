Calvary - 8.7.8 7.4.
1 Hark! the voice of love and mercy
Sounds aloud from Calvary;
See it rends the rocks asunder,
Shakes the earth, and veils the sky:
"It is finished,"
Hear the dying Saviour cry.

2.
"It is finished." Oh what pleasure
Do the wondrous words afford!
Heavenly blessings Without measure
Flow to us from Christ the Lord.
"It is finished,"
Saints the dying words record.

3.
Finished all the types and shadows
Of the ceremonial law,
Finished all that God had promised:
Death and hell no more shall awe.
"It is finished,"
Saints from hence your comfort draw

4.
Tune your harps anew, ye seraphs;
Strike them to Emmanuel's name.
All on earth, and all in heaven,
Join the triumph to proclaim.
Hallelujah!
Glory to the bleeding Lamb!
