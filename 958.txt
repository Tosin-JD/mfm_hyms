Awake! the Trumpet is Sounding!
1 Awake! for the trumpet is sounding!
Awake to its call, and obey!
The voice of our .Leader cries,
“Onward! 'Oh, let us no longer delay!

CHORUS
No truce while the foe is unconquer’d;
No laying the armour down!
No peace till the battle is ended,
And victory wins the crown!

2.
Then gird on the sword of the Spirit,
With helmet, and breast plate, and shied;
And valiantly follow your Captain,
Determin’d you never will yield!

3.
Then forward! O army of Zion,
With hearts that are loyal and brave!
Stand firm by the Cross and its banner.
And trust in the “Mighty to save!”
