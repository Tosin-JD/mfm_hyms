Deeper, Deeper

1.
Deeper, deeper in the love of Jesus
Daily let me go;
Higher, higher in the school of
wisdom.
More of grace to know
CHORUS
O deeper yet, I pray
And higher ev’ry day,
And wiser, blessed Lord
In Thy precious holy Word.

2.
Deeper, deeper, blessed Holy Spirit,
Take me deeper still,
Till my life is wholly lost in Jesus
And His perfect will.

3.
Deeper, deeper, tho’ it cost hard
trials.
Deeper let me go!
Rooted in the holy love of Jesus.
Let me fruitful grow.

4.
Deeper, higher ev'ry day in Jesus
Till all conflict past.
Finds me conqueror. and in His
image
Perfected at last
