God Is The Answer

1.
One day I was burdened, my mind was ill at ease,
I was searching for an answer,
I heard it in the trees, And they whispered to me;
“God is the answer, God is the answer,
God is the answer in the time of need.”

CHORUS
God is the answer, God is the answer,
God is the answer in the time of need.
God is the answer, God is the answer,
God is the answer in the time of need.

2.
He prospers and protects me ev’ry where I go.
Just when I need Him most,
He makes the blessings flow, I'm so glad I know that:
“God is the answer, God is the answer,
God is the answer in the time of need.”
