Through The Love Of God Our Saviour - 8.4.8.4.8.8.8.4.

1.
Through the love of God our Saviour,
All will be well;
Free and changeless is His favour,
All, all is well;
Precious is the blood that healed
Perfect is the grace that sealed us:
Strong the hand stretched forth to shield us,
All must be well.

2.
Though we pass through tribulation,
All will be well;
Ours is such a full salvation,
All, all is well:
Happy still in God confiding;
Fruitful if in Christ abiding;
Holy through the Spirit’s guiding;
All must be well.

3.
We expect a bright tomorrow;
All will be well;
Faith can sing through days of sorrow,
All, all is well:
On our Father’s love relying,
Jesus every need supplying,
Or in living or in dying,
All must be well.

- Mary Peters
