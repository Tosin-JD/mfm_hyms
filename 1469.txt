What Are These Arrayed In White -7 7 7.7.D.

1.
What are these arrayed in white
Brighter than the noonday sun?
Foremost of the sons of light,
Nearest the eternal throne?
These are they that bore the cross
Nobly of their Master stood;
Sufferers in His righteous cause,
Followers of the dying God.

2.
Out of great distress they came,
Washed their robes by faith below
In the blood of yonder Lamb
Blood that washes white as snow.
Therefore are they next the throne,
Serve their Maker day and night:
God resides among his own,
God doth in His saints delight.

3.
More than conquerors at last.
There they find trials o'er;
They have all their sufferings past,
Hunger now and thirst no more;
No excessive heat they feel
From the sun's direct ray.
In a milder clime they dwell,
Region of eternal day.

4.
That on the throne doth reign.
Them the Lamb shall always feed
With the tree of life sustain.'
To the living fountains lead;
He shall all their sorrows chase.
All their wantsat once remove,
Wipe the tears from every face,
Fill up every soul with love.

- Charles Wesley
