Send The Gospel Light

1.
Send the Light, oh, send it quickly
Far across the heaving main;
Speed the news of full salvation
Thro’ a dear Redeemer’s name.

CHORUS
Send the Light, oh, send it quickly
To the isles beyond the sea;
Let them hear the wondrous story
Love is boundless, grace is free!

2.
Send the Light, where souls are dying
In their darkness, gloom, and night;
Haste, oh, haste! the days are fleeting,
And the hours how swift their flight!

3.
Send the Light the Lord commands it;
To His Holy Word attend:
“Go ye forth and preach My gospel;
Lo! I’m with you to the end.”

- F. J. Crosby
