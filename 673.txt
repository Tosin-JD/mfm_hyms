St Christopher - 7.6.7.6.D.

1.
O Lamb of God, still keep me
Near to thy wounded side,
â€˜Tis only there in safety
And peace I can abide.
What foes and snares surround me;
What lusts and fears within!
The grace that sought and found me
Alone can keep me clean.

2.
Tis only in thee hiding,
I feel my life secure;
In thee alone abiding,
The conflict can endure:
Thine arm the victory gaineth
O'er ev'ry hurtful foe;
Thy love my heart sustaineth
In all its care and woe.

3.
Soon shall my eyes behold thee,
With rapture, face to face;
One half hath not been told me
Of all thy power and grace;
Thy beauty, Lord, and glory,
The wonders of thy love,
Shall be the endless story
Of all thy saints above.

- James George Deck
