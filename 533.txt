God Is Gone Up On High - 6.6.8.8.

1.
God is gone up on high,
With a triumphant noise;
The clarions of the sky
Proclaim the angelic joys!

CHORUS
Join all on earth, rejoice and sing;
Glory ascribe to gloryâ€™s King.

2.
God in the flesh below,
For us He reigns above:
Let all the nations know
Our Jesus' conquering love!

3.
All power to our great Lord
Is by the Father given;
By angel hosts adored,
He reigns supreme in heaven:

4.
High on His holy seat
He bears the righteous sway:
His foes beneath His feet
Shall sink and die away:

5.
His foes and ours are one,
Satan, the world, and sin;
But He shall tread them down,
And bring His kingdom in:
