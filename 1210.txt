Till He Come! Oh Let The Words - 7.7.7.D.

1.
'Till He come!” Oh let the words
Linger on the trembling chords;
Let the “little while" between
In their golden light be seen;
Let us think how heaven and home
Lie beyond that Till He come!”

2.
When the weary ones we love
Enter on their rest above
Seems the earth so poor and vast?
All our life-joy overcast?
Death and darkness and the tomb
Only whisper Till He come!”

3.
See the feast of love is spread,
Drink the wine and break the bread
Sweet memorials - till the Lord
Call us around His heavenly board;
Some from earth, from glory some,
Severed only Till He come!
