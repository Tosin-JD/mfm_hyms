REJOICE, ALL YE BELIEVERS


1.
Rejoice, all ye believers,
And let your lights appear;
The evening is advancing,
And darker night is near;
The Bridegroom is arising,
And soon He draweth nigh;
Up, pray, and watch, and wrestle,
At midnight comes the cry.

2.
See that your lamps are burning,
Replenish them with oil,
And wait for your salvation,
The end of earthly toil,
The watches on the mountain
Proclaim the Bridegroom near;
Go, meet Him as He cometh.
With Hallelujah clear.

3.
Ye wise and holy virgins,
Now raise your voices higher,
Until in songs triumphant
They meet the Angel choir,
The marriage-feast is waiting,
The gates wide open stand;
Up! up! ye heirs of glory,
The Bridegroom is at hand!

4.
Ye saints, who here in patience
Your cross and suffering bore.
Shall live and reign for ever,
When sorrow is no more,
Around the Throne of glory,
The Lamb ye shall behold,
In triumph cast before Him
Your diadems of gold.
