Dayspring - C. M.

1.
We have a King who came to earth
To win the world for God,
And we, the children of the King,
Must follow were he trod.

2.
The banner that our King unfurled
Was love to every man,
So we must try to show that love
In all the ways we can.

3.
The enemies he came to fight
Are selfishness and sin:
Then who would be a traitor now
And let his foemen in?

4.
He bids us keep our bodies pure,
For â€™tis the pure and clean
Can see the glory of the King,
And tell what they have seen.

5.
We are a little company,
But we are pledged to bring
Pure holy lives, kind joyful hearts,
And bring them to the King.

- Margaret Cropper
