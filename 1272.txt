Innocents -7.7.7.7.

1.
Gentle Jesus, meek and mild,
Look upon a little child,
Pity my simplicity,
Suffer me to come to Thee.

2.
Fain I would to Thee be brought;
Gracious Lord, forbid it not;
In the kingdom of Thy grace
Give a little child a place.

3.
Fain I would be as Thou art;
Give me Thy obedient heart;
Thou art pitiful and kind;
Let me have Thy loving mind.

4.
Let me above all fulfil
God my heavenly Fatherâ€™s will;
Never His good Spirit grieve,
Only to His glory live.

5.
Lamb of God, I look to Thee:
Thou shalt my example be:
Thou art gentle, meek, and mild:
Thou wast once a little child.

6.
Thou didst live to God alone;
Thou didst never seek Thine own;
Thou Thyself didst never please:
God was all Thy happiness.

7.
Loving Jesus, gentle Lamb,
In Thy gracious hands I am:
Make me, Saviour, what Thou art:
Live Thyself within my heart.

8.
I shall then show forth Thy praise,
Serve Thee all my happy days;
Then the world shall always see
Christ, the holy Child, in me.

- Charles Wesley
