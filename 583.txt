Regent Square - 8.7.8.7.8.7.

1.
Lo, He comes with clouds descending,
Once for favoured sinners slain;
Thousand thousand saints attending,
Swell the triumph of His train;
Alleluia! alleluia!
God appears on earth to reign.

2.
Every eye shall now behold Him,
Robed in dreadful majesty;
Those who set at naught and sold
Him,Pierced and nailed Him to the tree.
Deeply wailing, deeply wailing,
Shall the true Messiah see.

3.
Now redemption, long expected,
See in solemn pomp appear:
All His saints, by men rejected,
Now shall meet Him in the air
Alleluia! alleluia!
See the day of God appear.

4.
Yea, Amen! let all adore Thee,
High on Thine eternal throne;
Saviour, take the powâ€™r and glory,
Claim the kingdom for Thine own:
O, come quickly, O, come quickly!
Everlasting God, come down.

- Charles Wesley
