Ascension - 7.7.7.7. and Hallelujah

1.
Hail the day that sees Him rise,
Hallelujah!
To His throne above the skies;
Hallelujah!
Christ, awhile to mortals given,
Hallelujah!
Enters now the highest heaven:
Hallelujah!

2.
There for Him high triumph waits:
Hallelujah!
Lift your heads, eternal gates;
Hallelujah!
Christ hath conquered death and sin;
Hallelujah!
Take the King of glory in:
Hallelujah!

3.
Lo, the heaven its Lord receives,
Hallelujah!
Yet He loves the earth He leaves;
Hallelujah!
Though returning to His throne.
Hallelujah!
Still He calls mankind His own:
Hallelujah!

4.
See, He lifts His hands above;
Hallelujah!
See, He shows the prints of love;
Hallelujah!
Hark, His gracious lips bestow
Hallelujah!
Blessings on His Church below:
Hallelujah!

5.
Still for us He intercedes,
Halleluja!
His prevailing death He pleads.
Hallelujah!
Near Himself prepares our place,
Hallelujah!
He the first-fruits of our race:
Hallelujah!

6.
Lord, though parted from our sight,
Hallelujah!
Far above the starry height,
Hallelujah!
Grant our hearts may thither rise.
Hallelujah!
Seeking Thee above the skies:
Hallelujah!

- Charles Wesley
