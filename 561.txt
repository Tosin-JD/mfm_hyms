The Comforter Has Come

1.
O Spread the tidings' round.
Wherever man is found.
Wherever human hearts
and human woes abound;
Let ev’ry Christian tongue
proclaim the joyful sound;
The Comforter has come!

CHORUS
The Comforter has come,
The Comforter has come!
The Holy Ghost from Heav’n,
The Father’s promise giv’n;
O spread the tidings ‘round,
wherever man is found
The Comforter has come!

2.
The long, long night is past,
The morning breaks at last,
And hushed the dreadful wail
and fury of the blast,
As o’er the golden hills
the day advances fast!
The Comforter has come!

3.
Lo, the great King of kings,
with healing in His wings,
To ev’ry captive soul
a full deliv’rance brings;
And thro’ the vacant cells
the song of triumph rings;
The Comforter has come!

4.
O boundless love divine!
How shall this tongue of mine
To wond’ring mortals tell
the matchless grace divine
That I, a child of hell,
should in His image shine!
The Comforter has come!
