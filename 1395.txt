1.
O God, above the drifting years
The shrines our fathers founded stand,
And where the higher gain appears,
We trace the working of Thy hand.

2.
From out their tireless prayer and toil
Emerge the gifts that time has proved,
And seed laid deep in sacred soil
Yields harvests rich in lasting good.

3.
The torch to their devotion lent
Lightens the dark that round us lies;
Help us to pass it on unspent,
Until the dawn lights up the skies.

4.
Fill Thou our hearts with faith like theirs,
Who served the days they could not see;
And give us grace, through ampler years,
To build the kingdom yet to be.

- John Wright Buckham
