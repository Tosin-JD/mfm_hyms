Tours-7.6.7.6.D.

1.
When, His salvation bringing,
To Zion Jesus came,
The children all stood singing
Hosanna to His name;
forbid their zeal offend Him,
but, as He rode along,
He let them still attend Him,
And smiled to hear their song.

2.
And, since the Lord
retaineth
His love for children still.
Though now as King He reigneth
On Zion's heavenly hid.
Who sits upon the throne,
And cry aloud: Hosanna,
To David’s royal Son!

3.
For, should we fail proclaiming
Our great Redeemer’s praise,
The stones, our silence shaming,
Would their hosannas raise.
But shall we only render
The tribute of our words?
No! while our hearts are tender,
They too shall be the Lord’s.

- John King
