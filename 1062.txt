Jesus, Blessed Jesus

1.
There’s One who can comfort when all else fails,
Jesus, blessed Jesus;
A Saviour who saves tho' the foe assails,
Jesus, blessed Jesus;
Once He traveled the way we go.
Felt the pangs of deceit and woe;
Who more perfectly then can know
Than Jesus, blessed Jesus!

2.
He heareth the cry of the soul distressed,
Jesus, blessed Jesus;
He healeth the wounded, He giveth rest,
Jesus, blessed Jesus;
When from loved ones we’re called to part,
When the tears in our anguish start,
None can comfort the breaking heart
Like Jesus, blessed Jesus.

3.
He never forsakes in the darkest hour.
Jesus, blessed Jesus;
His arm is around us with keeping pow’r,
Jesus, blessed Jesus;
When we enter the Shadow land,
When at Jordan we trembling stand,
He will meet us with outstretched hand.
This Jesus, blessed Jesus.

4.
What joy it will be when we see His face,
Jesus, blessed Jesus;
Forever to sing of His love and grace,
Jesus, blessed Jesus:
There at home on that shining shore.
With the loved ones gone on before.
We will praise Him for ever more.
Our Jesus, blessed Jesus.
