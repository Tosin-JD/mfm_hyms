0 For A Faith That Will Not Shrink

1.
O for a faith that will not shrink,
Tho' pressed by ev’ry foe,
That will not tremble on the brink
Of any earthly woe.

2.
That will not murmur or complain
Beneath the chast'ning rod,
But in the hour of grief or pain,
Will lean upon its God.

3.
A faith that shines more bright and clear
When tempests rage without;
That when in danger knows no fear,
In darkness feels no doubt!

3.
Lord, give us such a faith as this;
And then, whate’er may come,
We'll taste e'er, here the hallowedbliss
Of an eternal home.
