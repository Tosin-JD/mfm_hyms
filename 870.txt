Jesus is Passing the Way

1.
Is there a heart that is waiting,
Longing for pardon today?
Hear the glad message proclaiming,
Jesus is passing this way.

CHORUS
Jesus is passing this way,
This way, today;
Jesus is passing this way.
Is passing this way today.

2.
Is there a heart that has wandered?
Come with thy burden today;
Mercy is tenderly pleading,
Jesus is passing this way.

3.
Is there a heart that is broken?
Weary and sighing for rest?
Come to the arms of thy Saviour,
Pillow thy head on His breast.

4.
Come to thy only Redeemer,
Come to His infinite love;
Come to the gate that is leading
Homeward to mansions above.
