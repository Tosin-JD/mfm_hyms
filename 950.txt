Doncaster - S.M.

1.
Quit you like men, be strong!
Wax valiant in the fight;
See! yonder Captain leads the
throng,
In Whom is your delight.

2.
Though battle’s thunders roar,
And hosts of darkness press,
He is alive for evermore,
And succours our distress.

3.
List to the swelling strains
Of those who fought and won,
They laud the Lamb, the crimson
stains
His vesture are upon:

4.
‘Twas through His precious blood,
Confession to His name,
And lives laid down, that they once
stood
And every foe o’ercame.

5.
Shall we, then, faint and fall
When strength seems all but gone?
Nay, rather, on your Captain call
And look to Him alone;

6.
“For I am strong when weak,”
O count this saying true,
The Lord doth strength and comfort
As no one else can do.
