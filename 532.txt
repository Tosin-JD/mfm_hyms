Victory - S.8.8.4.

1.
The strife is o’er, the battle done;
Now is the Victor’s triumph won;
Now be the song of praise begun;
Alleluia!

2.
The powers of death have done their worst,
But Christ their legions hath dispersed;
Let shouts of holy joy outburst:
Alleluia!

3.
The three sad days have quickly sped;
He rises glorious from the dead:
All glory to our risen Head: Alleluia!

4.
Lord, by the stripes which wounded Thee
From death’s dread sting Thy servants free,
That we may live and sing to Thee:
Alleluia!
