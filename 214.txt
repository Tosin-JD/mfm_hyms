Silent Night, Holy Night - 6.6.8.8.6.6.

1.
Silent night, holy night,
All is calm, all is bright
Round you Virgin Mother and Child
Holy infant so tender and mild,
Sleep in heavenly peace,
Sleep in heavenly peace.

2.
Silent night, holy night,
Darkness flies all is light,
Shepherds hear the angels sing,
â€œChrist the Saviour is born,
Christ the Saviour is born.

3.
Silent night, holy night
Guiding Star, lend Thy light;
See the eastern wise men bring,
Gifts and homage to our King!
Christ the Saviour is born,
Christ the Saviour is born.

4.
Silent night, holy night,
Wondrous Star, lend thy light;
With the angels let us sing.
Hallelujah to our King!
Christ the Saviour is born,
Christ the Saviour is born.
