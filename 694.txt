My Anchor Holds

1.
Tho' the angry surges roll
O’er my tempest driven soul,
I am peaceful, for I know,
Wildly thought the winds may blow,
I’ve an anchor safe and sure,
That shall evermore endure.

CHORUS
And it holds, my anchor holds;
Blow your wildest then, O gale,
On my bark so small and frail,
By His grace I shall not fail,
For my anchor holds, my anchor
holds.

2.
Mighty tides about me sweep,
Perils lurk within the deep,
Angry clouds o'er shade the sky,
And the tempest rises high;
Still I stand the tempest’s shock,
For my anchor grips the Rock.

3.
I can feel the anchor fast
As I meet each sudden blast,
And the cable, though unseen,
Bears the heavy strain between;
Thro’ the storm I safely ride,
Till the turning of the tide.

4.
Troubles almost 'whelrn the soul;
Griefs like billows o’er me roll;
Tempters seek to lure astray,
Storms obscure the light of day;
But in Christ I can be bold,
I've an anchor that shall hold.

- W. C. Martin
