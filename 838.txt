Give To The Winds Thy Fears - S.M.

1.
Give to the winds thy fears;
Hope, and be undismayed:
God hears thy sighs, and counts thy tears,
God shall lift up thy head.

2.
Through waves, and clouds, and storms
He gently clears thy way:
Wait thou His time, so shall this night
Soon end in joyous day.

3.
Thou seest our weakness, Lord
Our hearts are known to Thee:
lift Thou up the sinking hand,
Confirm the feeble kneel

4.
Let us in life, in death,
Thy steadfast truth declare
And publish with our latest breath
Thy love and guardian care.

- John Wesley
