The Conquering Saviour

1.
The conflict is over, the tempest is past,
I’m resting in Jesus, I’m resting at last;
The billows that filled my poor soul with alarm
Are hushed at His word into stillness and calm.

CHORUS
The conquering Saviour will breakev’ry chain,
And give us the vict'ry again and again;
The conquering Saviour Will break ev’ry chain,
And give us the vict’ry again and again.

2.
There’s peace in believing, sweet peace to the soul,
To know that He maketh me perfectly whole;
There’s joy everlasting to feel His Blood flow,
‘Tis life from the dead my Redeemer to know.

3.
Oh, hinder me not while His love I proclaim:
My soul makes her boast in His wonderful name;
I stand with my foot on the neck of my foe,
Then, bounding with gladness, triumphant I go.
