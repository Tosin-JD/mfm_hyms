Trusting Jesus

1.
Simply trusting every day,
Trusting through a stormy way;
Even when my faith is small,
Trusting Jesus that is all.

CHORUS
Trusting as the moments fly,
Trusting as the days go by;
Trusting Him whate’er befall,
Trusting Jesus that is all.

2.
Brightly doth His Spirit shine
Into this poor heart of mine.
While He leads I cannot fall.
Trusting Jesus that is all.

3.
Singing if my way is clear,
Praying if the path be drear;
If in danger, for Him call,
Trusting Jesus that is all.

4.
Trusting Him while life shall last
Trusting Him till earth be past;
Till within the jasper wall,
Trusting Jesus that is all.
