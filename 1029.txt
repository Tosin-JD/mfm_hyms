Jesus, Hold my hand

1.
As I travel thru this pilgrim land
There is a Friend who walks with me,
Leads me safely thru the sinking sand,
It is the Christ of Calvary;
This would be my pray’r, dear Lord, each day
To help me do the best I can,
For I need Thy light to guide me day and night,
Blessed Jesus, hold my hand.

2.
Let me travel in the light divine
That I may see the blessed way;
Keep me that I may be wholly Thine
And sing redemption’s song some day;
I will be a soldier brave and true
And ever firmly take a stand,
As I onward go and daily meet the foe,
Blessed Jesus, hold my hand.

3.
When I wander thru the valley dim
Toward the setting of the sun,
Lead me safely to a land of rest
If I a crown of life have won;
I have put my faith in Thee, dear
Lord,That I may reach the golden strand,
There’s no other friend on whom I can depend,
Blessed Jesus, hold my hand.
