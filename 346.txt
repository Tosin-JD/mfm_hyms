St. Mary - C. M.

1.
O Lord, turn not Thy face from me,
Who lie in woeful state,
Lamenting all my sinful life
Before Thy mercy-gate.

2.
A gate which opens wide to those
That do lament their sin;
Shut not that gate against me, Lord,
But let me enter in.

3.
I need not to confess my life
To Thee, who best can tell
What I have been; and what I am,
I know Thou know'st it well.

4.
So come I to Thy mercy-gate,
Where mercy doth abound,
Imploring pardon for my sin,
To heal my deadly wound.

5.
O Lord, I need not to repeat
The comfort I would have:
Thou know'st, O Lord, before I ask
The blessing I do crave.

6.
Mercy, good Lord, mercy I ask;
This is the total sum;
For mercy, Lord, is all my suit,
Lord, let Thy mercy come.

- J. Marckant
