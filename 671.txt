Sturges - C.M.

1.
Christ leads me through no darker rooms
Than he went through before;
And he that to Godâ€™s kingdom comes
Must enter by this door.

2.
Come, Lord, when grace hath made me meet
Thy blessed face to see:
For if thy work on earth be sweet.
What will thy glory be?

3.
My knowledge of that life is small,
The eye of faith is dim;
But "tis enough that Christ knows all.
And I shall be with him.

- Richard Baxter
