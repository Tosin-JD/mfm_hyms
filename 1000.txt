DO YOU FEAR THE FOE

1.
Do you fear the foe will in the conflict win?
Is it dark without you, darker still within?
Clear the darkened windows, open wide the door,
Let the blessed sunshine in.

CHORUS
Let a little sunshine in,
Let a little sunshine in;
Clear the darkened windows, open wide the door,
Let a little sunshine in.

2.
Does your faith grow fainter in the cause you love?
Are your prayers unanswered from the throne above?
Clear the darkened windows, open
wide the doorLet the blessed sunshine in.

3.
Would you go rejoicing on the upwind way,
Knowing naught of darkness-dwelling in the day?
Clear the darkened windows, open wide the door,
Let the blessed sunshine in.
