Thy Saviour Knows them All - D.C.M.

1.
O troubled heart, there is a balm
To heal thy ev'ry wound!
In Thy Redeemer’s blessing side
That balm alone is found.
The hidden anguish of the soul,
The burning tears the fall,
The sigh that rends thy arching breast
Thy Saviour knows them all.

2.
Go where no ear but His can hear,
No eye but His can see;
Has He not said that as thy day
E’en so thy strength shall be?
Though heaven and earth should pass away,
His word can never fail,
If thou by faith approach His throne,
By faith thou shalt prevail.

3.
Then why cast down? these
passing ills,
Thy path that sometimes dim,
Will work together for thy good
If thou but trust in Him:
The many blessings of the past
With gratitude recall;
Then tell thy sorrows at the feet
Of Him who knows them all.
