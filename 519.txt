Church Triumphant-8.8.8.8. (L.M.)

1.
The Lord is king! Lift up your voice,
O earth, and all you heavens, rejoice;
from world to world the song shall sing:
‘The Lord omnipotent is king!’

2.
The Lord is king! Who then shall dare
resist his will, distrust his care
or quarrel with his wise decrees,
or doubt his royal promise?

3.
The Lord is king! Child of the dust,
the judge of all the earth is just;
holy and true are all his ways
let every creature sing his praise!

4.
God reigns! He reigns with glory crowned:
let Christians make a joyful sound!
And Christ is seated at his side:
the man of love, the crucified.

5.
Come, make your needs, your burdens known:
he will present them at the throne;
and angel hosts are waiting there
his messages of love to bear.

6.
One Lord one kingdom all secures:
he reigns, and life and death are yours;
through earth and heaven one song shall ring:
'The Lord omnipotent is king!'

- J. Conder
