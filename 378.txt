Hendson -7.7.7.7. with Refrain

1.
Take my life and let it be
Consecrated, Lord, to Thee;
Take my moments and my days,
Let them flow in ceaseless praise.

2.
Take my hands and let them move
At the impulse of Thy love;
Take my feet and let them be
Swift and beautiful for Thee.

3.
Take my voice and let me sing
Always, only, for my King;
Take my lips and let them be
Filled with messages from Thee.

4.
Take my silver and my gold
Not a mite would I with-hold;
Take my intellect and use
Evâ€™ry pow'r as Thou shalt choose.

5.
Take my will and make it
Thine
It shall be no longer mine;
Take my heart it is Thine own,
It shall be Thy royal throne.

6.
Take my love my Lord, l pour
At Thy feet its treasure store;
Take myself and I will be
Ever, only, all for Thee.
