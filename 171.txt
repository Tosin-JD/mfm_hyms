Living word-11.10.11.10.

1.
Powerful in making us wise to salvation,
witness to faith in Christ Jesus the Word;
breathed out to men by the life giving Father
these are the scriptures, and thus speaks the Lord.

2.
Tool for employment and compass for travel,
map in the desert and lamp in the dark;
teaching, rebuking, correcting and training
these are the scriptures, and this is their work.

3.
History, prophecy, song and commandment,
gospel and letter and dream from on high;
written by men borne along by the Spirit
these are the scriptures; on them we rely.

4.
Gift for Godâ€™s servants to fit them completely,
fully equipping to walk in his ways;
guide to good work and effective believing
these are the scriptures, for these we give praise!,
