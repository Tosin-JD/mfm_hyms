Mighty Is The Lord


1.
Mighty is the Lord, our God 
give praise to His great name,
Saints of earth, and hosts of heav'n
proclaim abroad His fame;
Come rejoicing, shout "Hosanna"
that all men might see;
Mighty is the Lord who lives eternally.

CHORUS
Mighty is the Lord, the Lord who
dwells in the heavens
Mighty is the gracious Lord who
rules o'er the sea;
Mighty is the Lord of Hosts who
doth never slumber.
Mighty is the Lord who lives eternally.

2.
Holy is the Lord of Hosts, 
whose reign shall never cease,
He can save the fallen race and
give His servants peace;
All the earth should sing His
praises, for He makes us free;
Mighty is the Lord who lives eternally.

3.
Mighty is our God, Jehovah,
wondrous is His grace'
He is building now in heav'n, that
we might have a place;
How He makes us want to serve
Him, His own people be;
Mighty is the Lord who lives eternally.
