I’m a Millionaire

1.
I am now a child of God,
I’ve been washed in Jesus’ blood
Making me an heir to wealth beyond compare;
So while here I press along,
daily, this shall be my song,
I’m a happy millionaire.

CHORUS
I'm a millionaire, I'm a millionaire,
My Father is rich in houses and
lands and I’m His heir,
I’m a millionaire I’m a millionaire,
I’m a happy millionaire.

2.
I had rather serve my Lord,
feast upon His holy word,
Than to own the world with all its jewels rare;
By His Spirit I am led,
and on milk and honey fed,
I’m a happy millionaire.

3.
Lord, I’d rather worship Thee
with the people who are free,
Than the pleasures of this world a season share;
For my Father is the King,
and His praise I'll ever sing,
I’m a happy millionaire.

4.
Since salvation now is mine,
for the Lord I’ll shout and shine,
Tho’ I have to go ‘thru life on meagre fare;
Rich in grace beyond recall,
for my Father owns it all,
I’m a happy millionaire.
