Southwell - S.M.

1.
Oh perfect life of love!
All, all is finished now;
All that He left His throne above
To do for us below.

2.
No work is left undone
Of all the Father willed;
His toil, His sorrows, one by one,
The Scripture have fulfilled?-

3.
No pain that we can share
But He has felt its smart;
All forms of human grief and care
Have pierced that tender heart.

4.
And on His thorn-crowned head,
And on His sinless soul,
Our sins in all their guilt were laid.
That He might make us whole.

5.
In perfect love He dies:
For me He dies, for me:
O all atoning Sacrifice,
I cling by faith to Thee.

3.
In every time of need,
Before the judgement throne,
Thy work, O Lamb of God, I'll plead,
Thy merits, not my own.

4.
Yet work, O Lord, in me
As Thou for me hast wrought;
And let my love the answer be
To grace Thy love has brought.
