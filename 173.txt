Church Triumphant - L.M.

1.
The heavens declare Thy glory, Lord;
In every star Thy wisdom shines;
But when our eyes behold Thy word,
We read Thy name in fairer lines.

2.
Sun, moon, and stars convey Thy praise
Round the whole earth, and never stand;
So, when Thy truth began its race,
It touched and glanced on every land.

3.
Nor shall Thy spreading gospel rest
Till through the world Thy truth has run;
Till Christ has all the nations blest,
That see the light or feel the sun.

4.
Great Sun of righteousness, arise;
Bless the dark world with heavenly light;
Thy gospel makes the simple wise,
Thy laws are pure, thy judgements right.

5.
Thy noblest wonders here we view,
In souls renewed and sins forgiven:
Lord, cleanse my sins, my soul renew,
And make Thy word my guide to heaven.

- Isaac Watts
