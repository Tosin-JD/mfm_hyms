Bishopthorpe - C.M.

1.
This is the day the Lord has made,
he calls the hours his own:
let heaven rejoice, let earth be glad,
and praise surround the throne.

2.
Today he rose and left the dead,
and Satan’s empire fell;
today the saints his triumphs spread,
and all his wonders tell.

3.
Hosanna to the anointed king,
to David’s holy Son!
help us, O Lord; descend and bring
salvation from your throne.

4.
Blessed be the Lord, who freely came
to save our sinful race;
he comes, in God his Father’s name,
with words of truth and grace.

5.
Hosanna in the highest strains
the church on earth can raise!
the highest heaven in which he reigns 
shall give him nobler praise.

- Isaac Watts
