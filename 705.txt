Arden - C. M.

1.
Our Father hears us when we pray;
A whisper He can hear;
He knows not only what we say,
But what we wish or fear.

2.
'Tis not enough to bend the knee.
And words of prayer to say;
The heart mus' with the lips agree,
Or else we do not pray.

3.
Teach us, O Lord, to pray aright;
Thy grace to us impart,
That we in prayer may take delight.
And serve Thee with the heart.
