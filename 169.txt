Ravenshaw - 6.6.6.6.

1.
Lord your word shall guide us
and with truth provide us:
teach us to receive it
and with joy believe it.

2.
When our foes are near us,
then your word shall cheer us
word of consolation,
message of salvation.

3.
When the storms distress us
and dark clouds oppress us,
then your word protects us
and its light direct us.

4.
Who can tell the pleasure,
who recount the treasure
by your word imparted
to the simple hearted?

5.
Word of mercy, giving
courage to the living;
word of life, supplying
comfort to the dying.

6.
O that we discerning
its most holy learning,
Lord, may love and fear you
evermore be near you!
