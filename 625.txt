LIGHT, THAT FROM THE DARK ABYSS

1.
Light, that from the dark abyss
Madest all things, none amiss,
To share Thy beauty, share Thybliss,
Come to us: come.

2.
Light, that dost oâ€™er all things reign,
Light that dost all life maintain;
O Light, that dost create again,
Come to us: come.

3.
Light of men, that left the skies,
Light that look'd through human eyes,
And died in darkness as man dies,
Come to us: come.

4.
Light that stoop'd to rise and raise,
Soar'd to God above our gaze,
And still art with us all the days.
Come to us: come.

5.
Light that makest manifest,
Beautifiest, hallowest,
Light in Thy joyous strength at rest,
Come to us: come.

6.
Leave us not to say we see,
While we shut our eyes to Thee,
Who knockest very patiently;
Enter to us: come.

7.
All our good is Thine alone;
All our evil is our own;
Oh drive it from before Thy throne,
Come to us: come.

8.
Works of darkness put away;
With Thy harness us array
To walk in light and wait for day,
And Thee to come.

9.
We have done great wrong to Thee,
Yet we do belong to Thee;
Oh make our life one song to Thee.
Come to us: come.

10.
Come in all the majesty
Of Thy great humility;
Come, the whole world cries out to Thee,
Come to us: come.
