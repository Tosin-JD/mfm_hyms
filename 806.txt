St. David - C. M.

1.
My blessed Saviour, is Thy love
So great, so full, so free?
Behold, I give my love, my heart,
My life, my all, to Thee.

2.
I love Thee for the glorious worth
Which in Thyself I see;
0 love Thee for that shameful cross
Thou hast endured for me.

1.
Though in the very form of God,
With heavenly glory crownâ€™d,
Thou wouldst partake of human flesh
Beset with troubles round.

4.
Thou wouldst like wretched man be made,
In every thing but sin,
That we as like Thee might become
As we unlike had been.

1.
Like Thee in faith, in meekness, love.
In every beauteous grace;
From glory thus to glory changed,
As we behold Thy face.

- Ravenscroft
