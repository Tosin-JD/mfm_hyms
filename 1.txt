HOLY TRINITY

1.
Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
One in Three, and Three in One,
As by celestial host,
Let Thy will on earth be done;
Praise by all to Thee be given,
Glorious Lord of earth and heaven.

2.
If a sinner such as I
May to Thy great glory live,
All my actions sanctify,
All my words and thoughts receive;
Claim me for Thy service, claim
All I have, and all I am.

3.
Take my soul and body's powers;
Take my memory, mind, and will,
All my goods, and all my hours,
All I know, and all I feel,
All I think, or speak, or do;
Take my heart; but make it new!

4.
O my God, Thine own I am,
Let me give Thee back Thine own;
Freedom, friends, and health, and fame,
consecrate to Thee alone;
Thine to live, thrice happy I;
Happier still if Thine I die.

5.
Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
One in Three, and Three in One,
As by the celestial host,
Let Thy will on earth be done;
Praise by all to Thee be given,
Glorious Lord of earth and heaven.

- Charles Wesley
