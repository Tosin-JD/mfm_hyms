St. Michel’s-11.11.11.11.

1.
O Thou who in Jordan
didst bow Thy meek head,
And, ‘whelmed in our sorrows,
didst sink to the dead,
Then rose from the darkness
to glory above,
And claimed for Thy chosen
the kingdom of love.

2.
Thy footsteps we follow,
to bow in the tide,
And are buried with Thee in
the death Thou hast died;
Then wake in Thy likeness
to walk in the way
That brightens and brightens
to shadowless day.

3.
O Jesus, our Saviour,
O Jesus, our Lord,
By the life of Thy passion,
the grace of Thy word,
Accept us, redeem us,
dwell ever within. -
To keep, by Thy Spirit,
our spirits from sin.

4.
Till, crown’d with Thy glory,
and waving the palm,
Our garments all white from
the blood of the Lamb,
We join the bright millions
of saints gone before,
And bless Thee, and wonder,
and praise evermore.

- George W. Bethune
