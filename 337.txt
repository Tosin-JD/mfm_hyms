He’ A Wonderful Saviour To Me

1.
I was lost in sin but Jesus rescued me,
He's a wonderful Saviour to me;
I was bound by fear but Jesus set me free,
He’s a wonderful Saviour to me.

CHORUS
For He’s a wonderful Saviour to me,
He’s a wonderful Saviour to me;
I was lost in sin, but Jesus took me in.
He’s a wonderful Saviour to me.

2.
He’s a Friend so true, so patient and so kind,
He’s a wonderful Saviour to me;
Ev’rything I need in Him I always find,
He’s a wonderful Saviour to me!

3.
He is always near to comfort and to cheer,
He’s a wonderful Saviour to me;
He forgives my sins. He dries my ev’ry tear,
He’s a wonderful Saviour to me;

4.
Dearer grows the love of Jesus day by day,
He’s a wonderful Saviour to me;
Sweeter is His grace while pressing on my way,
He's a wonderful Saviour to me.
