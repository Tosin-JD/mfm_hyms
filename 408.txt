More Love To Thee

1.
More love to Thee, O Christ,
More love to Thee!
Hear Thou the pray’r I make
On bended knee;
This is my earnest plea:
More love. O Christ, to Thee,
More love to Thee,
More love to Thee!

2.
Once earthly joy I craved,
Sought peace and rest;-
Now Thee alone I seek,
Give what is best;
This all my pray’r shall be:
More love, O Christ, to Thee,
More love to Thee,
More love to Thee!
3 Then shall my latest breath
Whisper Thy praise;
This be the parting cry
My heart shall raise;
This still its pray’r shall be:
More love, O Christ, to Thee,
More love to Thee,
More love to Thee!
