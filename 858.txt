The Wonderful Story

1.
Oh, sweet is the story of Jesus,
The wonderful Saviour of men,
Who suffer’d and died for the sinner
I'll tell it again and again!

CHORUS
Oh, wonderful, wonderful story!
The dearest that ever was told;
I’ll repeat it in glory, The wonderful story,
Where I shall His beauty behold.

2.
He came from the mansions of glory;
His blood as a ransom He gave
To purchase eternal redemption
And oh, He is mighty to save!

3.
His mercy flows on like a river;
His love is unmeasured and free;
His grace is for ever sufficent,
It reaches and saves even me.

- C. H. Gabriel
