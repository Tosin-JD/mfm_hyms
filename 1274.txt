1.
Once in royal Davidâ€™s city
Mary was that mother mild,
Jesus Christ her little child.

2.
He came down to earth
from
heaven
Who is God and Lord of all.
And His shelter was a stable,
And His cradle was a stall.
With the poor, and meek, and lowlyLived on earth our Saviour holy.

3.
And through all His wondrous
childhood.
He would honour and obey,
Love, and watch the lowly maiden
Christian children all must be
Mild, obedient, good as He.

4.
For He is our childhood's pattern;
Day by day like us He grew;
He was little, weak, and helpless;
Tears and smiles like us He knew.
And He feeteth for our sadness,
And He shareth in our gladness.

5.
And our eyes at last shall see
Him,
Through His own redeeming love;
For that child so dear and gentle
Is our Lord in heaven above;
And He leads His children on
To the place where He is gone.
