Fisher-11.11.11.11. with Refrain

1.
Lord Jesus, I long to be perfectly whole;
I want Thee forever to live in my soul.
Break down every idol, cast out every foe
Now wash me and I shall be whiter
than snow.

CHORUS
Whiter than snow, yes, whiter than snow
Now wash me and I shall be whiter than snow.

2.
Lord Jesus, look down from Your throne in the skies
And help me to make a complete sacrifice.
I give up my self and whatever I know
Now wash me and I shall be whiter than snow.

3.
Lord Jesus, for this I most humbly entreat;
I wait, blessed Lord, at Thy crucified feet.
By faith, for my cleansing I see Your blood flow
Now wash me and I shall be whiter than snow.

4.
Lord Jesus, before You I patiently wait;
Come now and within me a new heart create.
To those who have sought You,
You never said, "No‚Äù
Now wash me and I shall be whiter than snow.
