Simeon - L. M.

1.
On all the earth Thy Spirit shower;
The earth in righteousness renew;
Thy kingdom come, and hell’s o'erpower.
And to Thy sceptre all subdue.

2.
Like mighty winds, or torrents fierce.
Let it opposers all o’errun;
And every law of sin reverse,
That faith and love may make all one.

3.
Yes, let Thy Spirit in every place
Its richer energy declare;
While lovely tempers, fruits of grace,
The kingdom of Thy Christ prepare.

4.
Grant this, O holy God and true!
The ancient seers Thou didst inspire;
To us perform the promise due;
Descend, and crown us now with fire.

- Henry More
