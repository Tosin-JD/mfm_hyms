Pearly Gates - 8.7.8.7. with Refrain

1.
Love divine, so great and wondrous,
Coming from the heart of Jesus
Just the same thru tests of time.
CHORUS
He the pearly gates will open,
So that I may enter in;
For He purchased my redemption,
And forgave me all my sin.

2.
Like a dove when hunted, frightened,
As a wounded fawn was I,
Broken hearted, yet He healed me
He will heed the sinner’s cry.

3.
Love divine, so great and wondrous
All my sins He then forgave,
I will sing His praise for ever,
For His blood, His pow'r to save.

4.
In life’s eventide, at twilight,
At His door I’ll knock and wait;
By the precious love of Jesus,
I shall enter heaven's gate.
