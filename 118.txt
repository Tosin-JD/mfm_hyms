Thuringia - 5.5.8.8.5.5.

1.
Round me falls the night;
Saviour, be my light;
Through the hours in darkness shrouded
Let me see thy face unclouded;
Let thy glory shine
In this heart of mine.

2.
Earthly work is done,
Earthly sounds are none;
Rest in sleep and silence seeking,
Let me hear thee softly speaking;
In my spirit’s ear
Whisper, ‘I am near.'

3.
Blessed, heavenly Light,
Shining through earth’s night;
Voice, that oft of love hast told me;
Arms, so strong to clasp and hold me;
Thou thy watch wilt keep,
Saviour, o’er my sleep.

- W. Romanis
