Coming - C. M.

1.
O watchman on the mountain height,
Proclaim the coming day;
Behold the spires of golden fires
Point upward far away.

CHORUS
Coming, yes, He’s coming,
The Day spring from on high;
Coming, yes, He's coming;
The promised hour is nigh;
Coming, yes, He’s coming;
Let all the ransom’d sing;
The hills are bright with shining light;
All hail the coming King!

2.
O watchman, bid the sleeping Church
Awake, arise, and pray;
The heav’nly Bridegroom soon will come,
And now is on His way.

3.
All hail to Zion’s glorious King,
By prophets long foretold;
Praise Him in song, ye angel throng,
Strike all your harps of gold.

- Rev W. O. Cushing
