Tell It To Jesus, All Of Thy Sorrow - P.M.

1.
Tell it to Jesus, all of thy sorrow,
All of thy cares whateâ€™er they be;
Surely and sweetly, He will deliver
He will sustain and comfort thee.

CHORUS
Tell it to Jesus, tell it to Jesus
Tell it to Jesus, He will hear,
Only believe, Him trust and receive Him,
He will sustain and comfort thee.

2.
Tell it to Jesus, He is thy Saviour,
Tell it, and His salvation see;
Do not deny Him, do not defy Him
He will sustain and comfort thee.

3.
Tell it to Jesus, He is a refuge,
Into His arms for mercy flee,
Tell it believing, tell it receiving
Grace to sustain and comfort thee.
