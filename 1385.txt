Speed Thy Servants, Saviour, Speed Them - 8.7.8.7,8.7.

1.
Speed thy servants, Saviour, speed them;
Thou art Lord of winds and waves:
They were bound, but Thou hast freed them;
Now they go to free the slaves.
Be Thou with them, Be Thou with them;
'Tis Thine arm alone that saves.

2.
Friends, and home, and all forsaking
Lord, they goat Thy command;
As their stay Thy promise taking,
While they traverse sea and land:
O be with them! O be with them!
Lead them safely by the hand.

3.
Where no fruit appears to cheer them,
And they seem to toil in vain,
Then in mercy, Lord, draw near them,
Then their sinking hopes sustain;
Thus supported, Thus supported,
Let their zeal revive again.

4.
In the midst of opposition,
Let them trust, O Lord, in Thee;
When success attends their mission,
Let Thy servants humbler be;
Never leave them, Never leave them,
Till thy face in heaven they see.

5.
There to reap in joy for ever
Fruit that grow from seed here sown,â€™
There to be with Him who never
Ceases to perserve His own,
And with gladness, And with gladness
Give the praise to Him alone.

- Thomas Kelly (1820)
