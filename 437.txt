He loved Me So

1.
By faith the Lamb of God I see
Expiring on the cross for me;
He paid the mighty debt I owe;
He died because He loved me so.

CHORUS
He loved me so, He loved me so,
He died because he loved me so.

2.
For me the Father sent His Son,
For me the victory He won;
To save my soul from endless woe,
He died because He loved me so.

3.
So glad I am that He is mine,
So glad that I with Him shall shine;
Iâ€™ll trust in Him, for this I know,
He died because He loved me so.
