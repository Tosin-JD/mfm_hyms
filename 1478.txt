I am Ready for Service

1.
Listen to the Master’s pleading,
There is urgent work for all;
Heed the Spirit’s interceding.
Give this answer to the call:

CHORUS
I am ready for service for
Thee, dear, Lord, Here am I, send me,
I am willing to be what you’d have me be,
I will go where you want me to go.
I am ready for service for Thee,
Dear Lord, Here am I, send me.

2.
There’s a voice to you now calling,
Will you heed the earnest word?
On the ear ‘tis gently falling,
Give this answer to your Lord:

3.
Many souls in sin are dying;
Haste to help them while you may.
For the time is swiftly flying.
Will you now to Jesus say?
