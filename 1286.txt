Winchester Old - C.M.

1.
O Lord, our hearts would give Thee praise,
Ere now our school we end;
For this Thy day, the best of days,
Jesus, the children's Friend.

2.
Lord, graft Thy word in every heart.
Our souls from sin defend.
That we from Thee may neâ€™er depart,
Jesus, the children's Friend.

3.
Lord, bless our homes and give us grace,
Thy Sabbaths so to spend,
That we in heaven may find a place.
With Thee, the Children's Friend.
