Sweet hour - L.M.D.

1.
Sweet hour of prayer, sweet hour of prayer,
That calls me from a world of care.
And bids me at my Father's throne
Make all my wants and wishes
known:In seasons of distress and grief.
My soul has often found relief,
And oft escaped the tempterâ€™s snare
By thy return, sweet hour of prayer

2.
Sweet hour of prayer, sweet hour of prayer,
Thy wings shall my petition bear
To Him whose truth and faithfulness
Engage the waiting soul to bless:
And since He bids me seek His face
Believe His Word, and trust His grace,
Til cast on Him my ev'ry care,
And wait for thee, sweet hour of prayer.

- William W. Walford
