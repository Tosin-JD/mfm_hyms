107
WARRINGTON - L. M.

1.
Forth in Thy Name, O Lord, I go,
My daily labour to pursue,
Thee, only Thee, resolved to know
In all I think, or speak, or do.

2.
The task Thy wisdom hath assigned
0 let me cheerfully fulfil.
In all my works Thy presence find,
And prove Thy good and perfect will.

3.
Thee may I set at my right hand,
Whose eyes mine inmost substance see.
And labour on at Thy command,
And offer all my works to Thee.

4.
Give me to bear Thy easy yoke.
And every moment watch and pray.
And still to things eternal look,
And hasten to Thy glorious day;

5.
For Thee delightfully employ
Whateâ€™er Thy bounteous grace hath given,
And run my course with even joy.
And closely walk with Thee to heaven

- Charles Wesley
