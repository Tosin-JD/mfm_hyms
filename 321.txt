321
ONLY A SINNER

1.
Naught have I gotten but what I received;
Grace hath bestowed it since I have believed;
Boasting excluded, pride I abase;
I’m only a sinner saved by grace!

CHORUS
Only a sinner saved by grace!
Only a sinner saved by grace!
This is my Story, to God be the glory,
I’m only a sinner saved by grave!

2.
Once I was foolish, and sin ruled my heart,
Causing my footsteps from God to depart;
Jesus hath found me, happy my case;
I now am a sinner saved by grace!

3.
Tears unavailing, no merit had I;
Mercy had saved me, or else I must die;
Sin had alarmed me, fearing God’s face;
But now I’m a sinner saved bygrace!

4.
Suffer a sinner whose heart overflows.
Loving his Saviour to tell what he knows;
Once more to tell it, would I embrace
I’m only a sinner saved by grace!

- James M. Gray
