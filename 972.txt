Morning Light - 7.6.7.6.D.


1.
Stand up! stand up for Jesus, 
Ye soldiers of the Cross!
Lift high His royal banner; 
It must not suffer loss.
From vict’ry unto vict’ry His army shall He lead,
Till ev’ry foe is vanquished, And
Christ is Lord indeed.

2.
Stand up! stand up for Jesus! The
trumpet call obey;
Forth to the mighty conflict. In this
His glorious day;
Ye that are men now serve Him
Against unnumbered foes;
Let courage rise with danger, And
strength to strength oppose.

3.
Stand up! stand up for Jesus!
Stand in His strength alone;
The arm of flesh will fail you. Ye
dare not trust your own;
Put on the gospel armour, Each
piece put on with prayer;
Where duty calls, or danger, Be
never wanting there.

4.
Stand up! stand up for Jesus! The
strife will not be long;
This day the noise of battle. The
next the victor’s song:
To Him that over cometh, 
A crown of life shall be;
He with the King of glory 
Shall reign eternally.
