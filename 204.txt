Owalywaly -8.8.8.8. (L.M.)

1.
Glad music fills the Christmas sky
a hymn of praise, a song of love;
the angels worship high above
and Mary sings her lullaby.

2.
Her costly love foreshadows pain
this gentle girl has much to bear;
the fingers twining in her hair
will grasp the hideous and profane.

3.
The angel armies of the skies
who tell God’s glory and his grace
have yet to know his human face,
to watch him die, to see him rise.

4.
Let praise be true and love sincere,
rejoice to greet the Saviour’s birth,
let peace and honour fill the earth
and mercy reign for God is here!

5. Then lift your hearts and voices high,
sing once again the Christmas song:
for love and praise to Christ belong
in shouts of joy, and lullaby.
