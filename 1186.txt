1.
Thee we adore, O hidden Saviour thee,
Who in thy Sacrament dost deign to be;
Both flesh and spirit at thy Presence fail,
Yet here thy Presence we devoutly hail.

2.
O blest memorial of our dying Lord,
Who living Bread to men doth here afford!
O may our souls for ever feed on thee,
And thou, O Christ, for ever precious be.

3.
Fountain of goodness, Jesu, Lord and God,
Cleanse us, unclean, with thy most cleansing Blood;
Increase our faith and love, that we may know
The hope and peace which from thy Presence flow

4.
O Christ, whom now beneath a veil we see,
May what we thirst for soon our portion be:
To gaze on thee unveiled, and see thy face,
The vision of thy glory and thy grace.

- St. Thomas Aquinas
