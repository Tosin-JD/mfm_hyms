647
He Knoweth The Way That I Take

1.
I have a friend who is ever nigh,
Whether I sleep or wake;
Ever he guards with a watchful eye,
He knoweth the way that I take.

CHORUS
He knoweth the way that I take,
And keeps me when asleep or awake;
And leads me in his own name’s sake
He knoweth the way that I take.

2.
I have a friend who is always neat,
One who will ne'er forsake;
What tho’ my pathway be dark and drear.
He knoweth the way that I take

3.
I have a friend who will guide me on
Until the shadows break;
Leading me in, till my crown is won;
He knoweth the way that I take.
