Love, Love

1.
I know the sweetest little word,
â€˜Tis Love, love;
The sweetest word man ever heard.
Is Love, love.

CHORUS
God's Love, love, Is wider than the sea;
It reaches all, yes, even me; God's
Love, love.

2.
It keeps me happy ev'ry day, His
Love, love;
It makes me sing along the way.
Love, love.

3.
It guides these little feet of mine,
His Love, love;
It keeps them in the path divine. His
Love, love.

- C. L. Dorris
