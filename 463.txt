Redemption! O Wonderful Story - 9.8.9.8.D

1.
Redemption! oh, wonderful story
Glad message for you and for me:
That Jesus has purchased our pardon,
And paid all the debt on the tree.

CHORUS
Believe it, O sinner, believe it;
Receive the glad message 'tis true;
Trust now in the crucified Saviour,
Salvation He, offers to you.

2.
From death unto life He hath
brought us,
And made us by grace sons of God;
A Fountain is opened for sinners:
Oh, wash and be cleansed in the blood!

3.
No longer shall sin have dominion,
Though present to tempt and annoy,
For Christ in His blessed redemption,
The power of sin shall destroy.

4.
Accept now God's offer of mercy;
To Jesus, oh, hasten today;
For He will receive him that cometh
And never will turn him away.

- P. Bilhom
