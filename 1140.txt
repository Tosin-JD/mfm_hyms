1.
Oft in danger, oft in woe,
Onward, Christians, onward go;
Fight the fight, maintain the strife,
Strengthen'd with the Bread of Life.

2.
Shrink not, Christians; will ye yield?
Will ye quit the painful field?
Will ye flee in danger's hour?
Know ye not your Captainâ€™s power?

3.
Let your drooping hearts be glad;
March in heavenly armour clad:
Fight, nor think the battle long;
Soon shall victory tune your song.

4.
Let not sorrow dim your eye,
Soon shall every tear be dry;
Let not fears your course impede,
Great your strength if great your need.

5.
Onward then to glory move,
More than conquerors ye shall prove;
Though opposed by many foe,
Christian soldiers, onward go.

- H. K. White
