Holy - L.M.

1.
We thank Thee, Lord, for this fair earth,
The glittering sky, the silver sea;
For all their beauty, all their worth,
Their light and glory, come from Thee.

2.
Thanks for the flowers that clothe the ground,
The trees that wave their arms above,
The hills that gird our dwellings round,
As Thou dost gird Thine own with love.

3.
Yet teach us still how far more faff,
More glorious, Father, in Thy sight,
Is one pure deed, one holy prayer,
One heart that owns Thy Spiritâ€™s might

4.
So, while we gaze with thoughtful eye
On all the gifts Thy love has given
Help us in Thee to live and die,
By Thee to rise from earth to heaven.

- George Edward, Lynch Cotton
