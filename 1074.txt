If God Be For Us-11.8.11.8. with Refrain

1.
Rejoice in the Lord oh, let His mercy cheer;
He sunders the bands that enthrall;
Redeem'd by His blood why should we ever fear
Since Jesus is our “all in all”?

CHORUS
“If God be for us, if God be for us. 
If God be for us,
Who can be against us? Who? who? who?
Who can be against us, against

2.
Be strong in the Lord! rejoicing in His might,
Be loyal and true day by day;
When evils assail, be valiant for the right,
And He will be our strength and stay.

3.
Confide in His word His promises
so sure;
In Christ they are “yea and amen”;
Though earth pass away, they evershall endure,
‘Tis written o’er and o’er again.

4.
Abide in the Lord: secure in His control,
'Tis life everlasting begun:
To pluck from His hand the
weakest, trembling soul
It never, never can be done!
