Stoerl - C. M.

1.
Father whose will is life and good
For all of mortal breath.
Bind strong the bond of brotherhood
Of those who fight with death

2.
Empower the hands and hearts and wills
Of friends both near and far, Who
battle with the body’s ills.
And wage thy holy war.

3.
Where’er they heal the maimed and blind,
Let love of Christ attend:
Proclaim the Good Physician's mind,
And prove the Saviour friend.

4.
O Father, look from heav'n and
bless,
Where’er thy servants be.
Their works of pure unselfishness.
Made consecrate to thee.

- Hardwicke Drummond Rawnsley
