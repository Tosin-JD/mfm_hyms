Duke Street - L.M.

1.
Awake, my tongue, thy tribute bring
To Him Who gave thee pow'r to sing;
Praise Him who is all praise above
The sources of wisdom of love.

2.
How vast His knowledge, how profound!
A deep where all our tho’ts are drowned;
The stars He numbers, and their names
He gives to all those heav’nly flames:

3.
Thro’ each bright world above, behold
Ten thousand thousand charms unfold;
Earth, air, and mighty seas combine
To speak His wisdom all divine.

4.
But in redemption, O what grace!
Its wonders, O what tho’t can race!
Here, wisdom shines for ever bright;
Praise Him, my soul, with sweet
delight.

- John Needham
