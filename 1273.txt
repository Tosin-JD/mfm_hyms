Newbury - C. M.

1.
I love to think, though I am young,
My Saviour was a child;
That Jesus walked this earth along,
With feet all undefiled.

2.
He kept His Father's word of truth.
As I am taught to do;
And while He walked the paths of youth,
He walked in wisdom too.

3.
I love to think that he who spake
And made the blind to see.
And called the sleeping dead to wake,
Was once a child like me.

4.
That He who wore the thorny crown.
And tasted death's despair,.
Had a kind mother like my own,
And knew her love and care.

5.
I know 'twas all for love of me
That he became a child.
And left the heavens, so fair to see.
And trod earth's pathway wild.

6.
Then, Saviour, who wast once a child,
A chilild may come to Thee;
And O in all Thy mercy mild.
Dear Saviour, come to me!
