WE’VE NO ABIDING CITY HERE

1.
We’ve no abiding city here:
This may distress the worldling’s mind;
But should not cost the saint a tear,
Who hopes a better rest to find.

2.
' We’ve no abiding city here;
Sad truth, were this to be our home;
But let the thought our spirits cheer,
We seek a city yet to come.

3.
We've no abiding city here;
We seek a city out of sight;
Zion its name: the Lord is there:
It shines with everlasting light.

4.
Zion, Jehovah is her strength:
Secure, she smiles at all her foes;
And weary travellers at length
Within her sacred walls repose.

5.
O sweet abode of peace and love.
Where pilgrims freed from toil are bless’d,
Had I the pinions of a dove,
I’d fly to thee and be at rest.

6.
But hush, my soul, nor dare repine;
The time my God appoints is best:
While here, to do His will be mine;
And His, to fix my time of rest.
