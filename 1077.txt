Tryphena-8.8.8.

1.
Why should I fear the darkest hour,
Or tremble at the tempterâ€™s power?
Jesus vouchsafes to be my Tower.

2.
Though hot the flight, why quit the field?
Why must I either flee or yield?
Since Jesus is my mighty Shield?

3.
When creature comforts fade and die,
Worldlings may weep, but why should I?
Jesus still lives and still is nigh.

4.
Though all the flocks and herds were dead,
My soul a famine need not dread,
For Jesus is my living Bread.

5.
I know not what may soon betide,
Or how my wants shall be supplied;
But Jesus knows, and will provide.

6.
Though sin would fill me with distress,
The throne of grace I dare address.
For Jesus is my Righteousness.

7.
Though faint my prayers and cold my love,
My steadfast hope shall not remove
While Jesus intercedes above.

8.
Against me earth and hell combine;
But on my side is power Divine;
Jesus is all, and He is mine.
