Satisfied - 8.7.8.7. with Refrain

1.
All my life long I had panted
For a drink, from some clear spring,
That I hoped would quench the burning
Of the thirst I felt within.

CHORUS
Hallelujah! I have found Him
Whom my soul so long has craved!
Jesus satisfies my longings
Thru His blood I now am saved.

2.
Feeding on the husks around me,
Till my strength was almost gone.
Longed my soul for something better,
Only still to hunger on.

3.
Well of water ever springing.
Bread of life so rich and free,
Untold wealth that never faileth,
My Redeemer is to me.

- Clara T. Williams
