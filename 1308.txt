The Great Physician Now Is Near

1.
The great Physician now is near,
Thy sympathising Jesus;
He speaks the drooping hear to cheer,
Oh hear the voice of Jesus

CHORUS
Sweetest note in seraph song,
Sweetest name on mortal tongue
Sweetest carol ever sung,
Jesus, blessed Jesus.

2.
Your many sins are all forgiv’n,
Oh. hear the voice of Jesus;
Go on your way in peace to heav’n,
And wear a crown with Jesus.

3.
All glory to the dying Lamb!
I now believe in Jesus:
I love the blessed Saviour's name,
I love the name of Jesus..

1.
His name dispels my guilt and fear.
No other name but Jesus,
Oh! how my soul delights to hear
The precious name of Jesus.

- Wm. Hunter
