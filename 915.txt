915
Blessed Redeemer

1.
Up Calv’ry's mountain, on dreadful morn,
Walked Christ my Saviour, weary
and worn;Facing for sinners death on the cross,
That He might save them from endless loss.

CHORUS
Blessed Redeemer, precious Redeemed
Seems now I see Him on Calvary’s tree,
Wounded and bleeding, for sinners pleading
Blind and unheeding dying for me!

2.
“Father, forgive them!” thus did He pray,
E’en while His life blood flowed fast away;
Praying for sinners while in such woe
No one but Jesus ever loved so.

3.
O how I love Him, Saviour and Friend!
How can my praises ever find end!
Thru years unnumbered on heaven’s shore,
My tongue shall praise Him for
evermore.
