Maccabaeus -10.11.11.11.and Refrain

1.
Thine be the glory, risen, conquering Son,
Endless is the victory Thou o'er death has won;
Angels in bright raiment rolled the stone away,
Kept the folded grave-clothes, where Thy body lay.

CHORUS
Thine be the glory, risen conquering Son,
Endless is the victory Thou o'er death has won.

2.
Lo! Jesus meets us, risen from the tomb;
Lovingly He greets us, scatters fear and gloom;
Let the Church with gladness, hymns of triumph sing,
For her Lord now liveth, death hast lost its sting.

3.
No more we doubt Thee, glorious Prince of life;
Life is naught without Thee: aid us in our strife;
Make us more than conquerors, through Thy deathless love;
Bring us safe through Jordan to Thy home above.
