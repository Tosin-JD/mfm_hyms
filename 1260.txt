Camber - 6.5.6.5.

1.
Little drops of water,
Little grains of sand,
Make the mighty ocean

2.
Little deeds of kindness,
Little words of love,
Make our earth an Eden,
Like the heavens above.

3.
Little seeds of mercy
Sown by youthful hands,
Grow to bless the nations
Far in other lands.

4.
Glory then for ever
Be to God on high,
Beautiful and loving,
To etemity.

- Mrs. J. A. Carney
