885
Come Unto Me

1.
Hear the blessed Saviour calling the oppressed,
“O ye heavy laden, come to Me and rest,
Come, no longer tarry, I your load will bear,
Bring Me ev’ry burden, bring me ev'ry care

CHORUS
Come unto Me; I will give you rest;
Take My yoke upon you, Hear Me and be blest;
I am meek and lowly, Come and trust My might;
Come. My yoke is easy, And My burder s light.

2.
Are you disappointed, wand'ring here and there,
Dragging chains of doubt and loaded down with care?
Do unholy feelings struggle in your breast?
Bring your case to Jesus, He will give you rest.

3.
Stumbling on the mountains dark with sin and shame,
Stumbling tow’rd the pit of hell’s consuming flame,
By the pow’rs of sin deluded and oppressed
Hear the tender Shepherd, “Come to Me and rest,”

4.
Have you by temptation often conquered been,
Has a sense of weakness brought distress within?
Christ will sanctify you, if you'll claim His best,
In the Holy Spirit, He will give you rest.
