Turn to the Lord

1.
Onward! upward! Blood washed Soldier,
Turn not back, nor sheathe thy sword,
Let its blade be sharp for conquest
In the battle for the Lord.

2.
From the great White Throne eternal
God Himself is looking down;
He it is who now commands thee:
Take the cross and win the crown!

3.
Onward! upward I doing, daring
AH for Him who died for thee;
Face the foe, and meet with boldness
Danger, whatsoe'er it be.

4.
From the battlements of Glory
Holy ones are looking down;
Thou canst almost hear them shouting,
'On! let no one take thy crown!'

5
Onward! till thy course is finished;
Like the ransomed ones before,
Keep the faith through persecution,
Never give the battle oâ€™er.

6.
Onward! upward! till, victorious,
Thou shalt lay thine armour down,
And thy loving Saviour bids thee
At His hand receive thy crown.
