Jesus is passing by - C.M.

1.
Come, weary one, and find sweet rest:
Jesus is passing by!
Come where the longing heart is blest,
And on His word rely.

CHORUS
Passing by! Passing by!
Hasten to meet Him on the way,
Jesus is passing by today!
Passing by! Passing by!

2.
Come, burden’d one, bring all your care:
Jesus is passing by!
The love that listens to your pray’r
Will “no good thing" deny.

3.
Come, hungry one, and tell your need:
Jesus is passing by!
The Bread of Life your soul will feed.
And fully satisfy.

4.
Come, contrite one, and seek His grace:
Jesus is passing by!
See in His reconciled face
The sunshine of the sky.
