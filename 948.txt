Hold the fort

1.
Ho, my comrades! see the signal
Waving in the sky!
Reinforcements now appearing,
Victory is nigh!

CHORUS
“Hold the fort, for I am coming,”
Jesus signals still;
Wave the anser back to heaven,
“By Thy grace we will.”

2.
See the mighty host advancing.
Satan leading on:
Mighty men around us falling,
Courage almost gone!

3.
See the glorious banner waving!
Hear the trumpet blow!
In our Leader’s name we’ll triumph
Over ev’ry foe!

4.
Fierce and long the battle rages,
But our help is near:
Onward comes our great Commander,
Cheer, my comrades, cheer!
