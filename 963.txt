963
Fall into Line - 8.7.
1 Over hill and lofty mountain,
Hear the gospel trumpet call;
Listen to the strains inspiring,
Tis a message for us all.

CHORUS
Fall into line for the conflict!
Fall into line for the conflict!
Rally at the trumpet’s call, rally!
Rally Christian soldiers all!

2.
Girding on the royal armour,
Wave the glorious banner high!
While for truth and right
contending,
Angels watch you from the sky.

1.
Sound again the silver trumpet!
Sound aloud the battle-cry!
“All for Jesus, all for Jesus!
We shall conquer though we die!

- Wm. H. Gardner
