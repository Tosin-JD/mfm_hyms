226
The way, the truth, the life.

1.
I am the Way,” the Saviour said,
And I would follow on,
Content to know that after night
Shall break a glorious dawn.

CHORUS
I am the way. the Truth, and the Life,
No man cometh unto the Father but by Me
No man cometh unto the Father but by Me.

2.
"I am the Truth;” then Truth shall be
A beacon light to guide
My bark across the stormy sea
To whore still waters glide.

3.
“l am the Life," there is no death
For me to tear, nor dread,
Since by His all atoning blood
My life to His is wed.
