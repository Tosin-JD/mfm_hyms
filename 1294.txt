1.
Heal me, hands of Jesus
and search out all my pain;
restore my hope, remove my fear
and bring me peace again.

2.
Cleanse me. blood of Jesus.
take bitterness away;
let me forgive as one forgiven
and bring me peace today.

3.
Know me, mind of Jesus,
and show me all my sin;
dispel the memories of guilt
and bring me peace within.

4.
Fill me, joy of Jesus:
anxiety shall cease
and heaven's serenity be mine,
for Jesus brings me peace!
