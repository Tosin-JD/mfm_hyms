104

MY GOD, HOW ENDLESS IS THY LOVE

1.
My God, how endless is Thy love;
Thy gifts are every evening new;
And morning mercies from above
Gently distil, like early dew.

2.
Thou spreadst the curtains of the night,
Great Guardian of my sleeping hours:
Thy sovereign word restores the light,
And quickens all my slumbering powers.

3.
I yield my life to Thy command.
To Thee I consecrate my days:
Perpetual blessings from Thine hand
Demand perpetual songs of praise.

- Isaac. Watts
