769
Christ the Fountain

1.
Fountain of purity open’d for sin,
Here may the penitent wash and be clean;
Jesus, Thou blessed Redeemer from woe,
Wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.

CHORUS
Whiter than snow,
whiter than snow;
Wash me, Redeemer,
and I shall be whiter than snow.

2.
Tho’ I have labour’d again and again,
All my self-cleansing is utterly vain;
Jesus, Redeemer from sorrow and woe,
Wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.

3.
Cleanse Thou the thoughts of my heart, I implore;
Help me Thy light to reflect more and more;
Daily in loving obedience to grow,
Wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.

4.
Whiter than snow I nothing farther need;
Christ is the Fountain: this only I plead;
Jesus, my Saviour, to Thee will I go
Wash me, and I shall be whither than snow.

- Rev. Newman Hall, D. D.
