Come, Holy spirit

1.
The Holy spirit came at Pentecost
He came in mighty fullness then;
His witness thru believers won the lost,
and multitudes were born again.
The early Christians scattered o’er the world
They preached the gospel fearlessly;
Tho some were martyred and to lions hurled,
They marched along in victory!

CHORUS
Come, Holy spirit, dark is the hour,
We need Your filling,
Your love and Your mighty pow'r
Move now among us,
Stir us, we pray,
Come, Holy spirit,
Revive the Church today!

2.
Then in an age when darkness gripped the earth,
"The just shall live by faith” was learned;
The Holy spirit gave the Church new birth
As reformation fires burned.
In later years the great revivals came
When saints would seek the Lord and pray;
O once again we need that holy flame
To meet the challenge of today!
