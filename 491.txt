The Whole Bright World Rejoices

1.
The whole bright world rejoices now,
Alleluia, Alleluia!
The birds do sing on every bough.
Alleluia, Alleluia!

2.
Then shout beneath the racing skies,
Alleluia, Alleluia!
To Him that rose that we might rise,
Alleluia, Alleluia!

3.
And all you living things, make praise,
Alleluia, Alleluia!
He guideth you in all your ways,
Alleluia, Alleluia!

4.
"He, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
Alleluia, Alleluia!
Our God most high, our Joy and Boast,
Alleluia, Alleluia!
