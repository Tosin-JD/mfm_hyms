232
Oh, it is glory

1.
Oh, if you could know my Saviour,
If you could but taste and see,
If you knew your sins forgiven,
Heav’n on earth it then would be.

CHORUS
Oh, it is glory! Oh, it is glory!
Oh, it is glory in my soul.
Jesus hath saved me, He has redeem’d me,
Oh, it is glory in my soul.

2.
I will tell you why the glory
Streams so freely in my soul;
I have been receiv’d by Jesus,
He has made my spirit whole.

3.
He has stoop’d low down from heaven,
Stoop’d so low my soul to win;
And I know and feel He pardons,
Now I know He takes me in.

4.
This is why the heav’nly glory
Now comes streaming thro’ my soul;
Glory, glory be to Jesus,
For His blood has made me whole.
