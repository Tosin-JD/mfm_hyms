My Father Watches Over Me

1.
I trust in God whenever I may be
Upon the land or on the rolling sea,
For, come what may, From day to day,
My heav'nly Father watches over me.

CHORUS
I trust in God, I know He cares for me,
On mountain bleak or on the stormy sea;
Tho’ billows roll, He keeps my soul,
My heav’nly Father watches over me.

2.
He makes the rose an object of His care,
He guides the eagle thru the pathless air,
And surely He Remembers me,
My heav’nly Father watches over me

3.
I trust in God, for, in the lion’s den,
On battle field, or in the prison pen.
Thru praise or blame, Thru flood or flame.
My heav’nly Father watches over me.

4.
The valley may be dark, the shadows deep,
But O, the Shepherd guards His lonely sheep;
And thru the gloom He’ll lead me home,
My heav’nly Father watches over me.

- Rev. W. C. Martin
