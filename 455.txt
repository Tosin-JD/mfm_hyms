455
Once For All

1.
Free from the law, O happy condition!
Jesus hath bled, and there is remission;
Cursed by the law and bruised by the fall,
Grace hath redeemed us once for all.

CHORUS
Once for all, O sinner, receive it!
Once for all, O brother, believe it!
Cling to the cross, the burden will fall;
Christ hath redeemed us once for all!

2.
Now are we free, there’s no condemnation!
Jesus provides a perfect salvation;
“Come unto Me” O hear His sweet call!
Come and He saves us once for all.

3.
Children of God, O glorious calling!
Surely His grace will keep us from falling;
Passing from death to life at His call,
Blessed salvation once for all.
