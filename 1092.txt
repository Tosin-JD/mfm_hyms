Breslau - L.M.

1.
Take up thy cross, the Saviour said.
If thou wouldst my disciple be;
Deny thyself, the world forsake,
And humbly follow after me.

2.
Take up thy cross; let not its weight
Fill thy week spirit with alarm;
'His strength shall bear thy spirit up,
And brace thy heart, and nerve thine arm.

3.
Take up thy cross, nor heed the shame,
Nor let thy foolish pride rebel;
The Lord for thee the Cross endured,
To save thy soul from death and hell.

4.
Take up thy cross then in his strength,
And calmly every danger brave;
Twill guide thee to a better home,
And lead to victory o'er the grave.

5.
Take up thy cross, and follow Christ
Nor think till death to lay it down;
For only he who bears the cross
May hope to wear the glorious crown.

6.
To thee, great Lord, the One in Three,
All praise for evermore ascend;
O grant us in our Home to see
The heavenly life that knows no end.
