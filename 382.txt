1.
I would be true, for there are those that trust me;
I would be pure, for there are those
who care;
I would be strong, for there is much
to suffer;
I would be brave, for there is muchto dare,
I would be brave for there is much to
dare.

2.
I would be friend of all the foe, the friendless;
I would be giving, and forget the gift;
I would be humble, for I know my weakness;
I would look up, and laugh, and love, and lift,
I would look up, and laugh, and love, and lift.

3.
I would be prayerful throâ€™ each busy moment;
I would be constantly in touch with God;
I would be tuned to hear the slightest whisper;
I would have faith to keep the path Christ trod,
I would have faith to keep the path Christ trod.
