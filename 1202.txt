Belmont - C.M.

1.
According to Thy gracious word,
In meek humility.
This will I do. my dying Lord:
I will remember Thee.

2.
Thy body, broken for my sake,
My bread from heaven shall be;
Thy testamental cup I take,
And thus remember Thee.

3.
Gethsemane can I forget?
Or there Thy conflict see,
Thine agony and bloody sweat,
And not remember Thee?

4.
When to the cross I turn mi ne eyes,
And rest on Calvary,
0 Lamb of God, my sacrifice,
1 must remember Thee:

1.
Remember Thee, and all Thy pains,
And all Thy love to me;
Yea, while a breath, a pulse remains,
Will I remember Thee.

2.
And when these failing lips grow
dumb,
And mind and memory flee,
When Thou shalt in Thy kingdom come
Then. Lord, remember me.
