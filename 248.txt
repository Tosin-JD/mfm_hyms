Life for a look

1.
There is life for a look at the Crucified One,
There is life at this moment for thee.
Then look, sinner, look unto Him and be saved,
Unto Him who was nailed to the tree.

CHORUS
Look, look, look and live,
There is life for a look at the Crucified One,
There is life at this moment for Thee.

2.
Oh, why was He there as a Bearer of sin.
If on Jesus thy sins were not laid?
Oh, why from His side flowed the
sin cleansing blood,
If His dying thy debt has not paid?

3. It is not thy tears of repentance nor prayers,
But the blood that atones for the soul;
On Him then believe, and a pardon receive,
For His blood can now make thee suite whole

4.
We are healed by His stripes;
wouldst thou add to the word?
And He is our righteousness made;
The best robe of heaven He bids
thee to wear.
Oh, couldst thou be better arrayed?

5.
Then doubt not thy welcome, since God has declared
There remaineth no more to be done;
That once in the end of the world He appeared,
And completed the work He begun.

6.
But take, with rejoicing, from Jesus at once.
The life everlasting He gives;
And know with assurance thou never canst die,
Since Jesus thy righteousness lives.
