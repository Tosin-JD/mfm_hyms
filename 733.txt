Garden - Irregular

1.
I come to the garden a lone,
While the dew is still on the roses;
And the voice I hear, falling on my ear,
The Son of God discloses.

CHORUS
And He walks with me, and He talks with me,
And He tells me I am His own;
And the joy we share as we tarrythere
None other has ever known.

2.
He speaks, and the sound of His voice
Is so sweet the birds hush their singing;
And the melody that He gave to me
Within my heart is ringing.

3.
Iâ€™d stay in the garden with Him
Tho the night around me be falling;
But He bids me go thru the voice of woe,
His voice to me is calling.

- C. Austin Miles
