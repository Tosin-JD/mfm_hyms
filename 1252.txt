Goshen -6.5.6.5.D.

1.
Jesus is our Shepherd,
Wiping ev’ry tear;
Folded in His bosom.
What have we to fear?
Only let us follow
Whither He doth lead,
To the thirsty desert
Or the dewy mead.

2.
Jesus is our Shepherd;
Well we know His voice;
How its gentle whisper
Makes our heart rejoice!
Even when He chideth,
Tender is His tone;
None but He shall guide us;
We are His alone.

3.
Jesus is our Shepherd:
For the sheep He bled;
Every lamb is sprinkled
With the blood He shed;
Then on each He setteth
His own secret sign;
‘They that have My Spirit,
These, ‘saith He, ‘are Mine.’

4.
Jesus is our Shepherd;
Guarded by His arm.
Though the wolves may-raven,
None can do us harm;
When we tread death's valley,
Dark with fearful gloom.
We will fear no evil,
Victors o'er the tomb.
