1376
Birstal - L.M.

1.
Shall I, tor tear of feeble man;
The Spirit's course in me restrain?
Or, dismayed, in deed and word
Be a true witness for my Lord?

2.
Saviour of men, Thy searching eye
Doth all my inmost thoughts descry,
Doth aught on earth my wishes raise,
Or the world’s pleasures or its praise?

3.
The love of Christ doth me constrain
To seek the wandering souls of men;
With cries, entreaties, tears, to save,
To snatch them from the gaping grave

4.
My life, my blood, I here present.
If for Thy truth they may be spent:
Fulfill Thy sovereign counsel. Lord:
Thy will be done. Thy name adored

5.
Give me Thy strength, O God of power:
Then, let winds blow or thunders
roar;Thy faithful witness will I be:
‘Tis fixed; I can do all through Thee!

- Johann Joseph Winckler
