You mean to be saved - but when

1.
You mean to be saved but when?
No longer the blessing delay;
Now, now, is the time accepted,
O come and be saved today!

CHORUS
You mean to be saved but when?
You mean to be saved but when?
He loves you. He calls you,
He’s waiting just now,
You mean to be saved but when?

2.
You mean to be saved but when?
The way is provided and free;
He will not compel, O choose Him,
Your Saviour and Friend to be!

3.
You wish to be saved but when?
No longer a wanderer roam;
Believe and receive full pardon,
You mean to be saved come home!

4.
You hope to be saved you say.
You’ve said it again and again;
You may not behold tomorrow,
You mean to be saved but when

- Mrs. Frank A. Breck
