Will You Love My Saviour

1.
Tell me, will you love my Saviour?
He would be your dearest Friend:
He would be your soul’s Redeemer
And your guide till life shall end.

CHORUS
Will you, will you love my Saviour?
Tis the prayer my spirit plead;
Will you love my dear Redeemer?
He is all the sinner needs.

2.
He will comfort in the sadness,
Ev’ry life must sometimes know,
And your heart will need the
gladness
That His friendship can bestow.

3.
Oh, you must not miss the blessing
That a life with Him will give;
Come to Him, your sin confessing.
He will make you glad to live.

4.
Tell me, will you love my Saviour?
May I know it ere I die?
In the realms of joy and glory,
Will you meet me, by and bye?

- Mrs. Frank A. Breck
