JESUS MAY COME TODAY

1.
Jesus may come today, Glad day! Glad day!
And I would see my Friend;
Dangers and troubles would end
If Jesus should come today.

CHORUS
Glad day! Glad day! Is it the crowning day?
Iâ€™ll live for today, nor anxious be,
Jesus, my Lord, I soon shall see;
Glad day! Glad day! Is it the crowning day?

2.
I may go home today,
Glad day! Glad day!
Seemeth I hear their song;
Hail to the radiant throng!
If I should go home today.

3.
Why should I anxious be? Glad
day! Glad day!
Lights appear on the shore,
Storms will affright never more.
For he is at hand today.

4.
Faithful I'll be today,
Glad day! Glad day!
And I will freely tell
Why I should love him so well,
For he is my all today.
