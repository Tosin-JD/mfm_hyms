Pass Me Not - 8.5.8.5. with Refrain

1.
Pass me not, O gentle Saviour
Hear my humble cry!
While on others Thou art calling,
Do not pass me by.

CHORUS
Saviour, Saviour,
Hear my humble cry!
While on others Thou art calling,
Do not pass me by.

2.
Let me at a throne of mercy
Find a sweet relief;
Kneeling there in deep contrition
Help my unbelief.

3.
Trusting only in Thy merit,
Would I seek Thy face;
Heal my wounded, broken spirit,
Save me by Thy grace.

4.
Thou the spring of all my comfort,
More than life to me!
Whom have I on earth beside Thee?
Whom in heavâ€™n but Thee?

- Fanny J. Crosby
