653
Woolwich - S.M.

1.
Away, my needless fears,
And doubts no longer mine;
A ray of heav'nly light appears,
A messenger divine.

2.
Thrice comfortable hope,
That calms my troubled breast;
My Fatherâ€™s hand prepares the cup,
And what He wills is best.

3.
If what I wish is good,
And suits the will divine;
By earth and hell in vain withstood,
I know it shall be mine.

4.
Still let them counsel take
To frustrate His decree,
They cannot keep a blessing back
By heaven designed for me.

5.
Here then I doubt no more,'
But in His pleasure rest,
Whose wisdom, love, and truth,
and power
Engage to make me blest.

6.
To accomplish His design
The creatures all agree;
And all the attributes divine
Are now at work for me.

- C. Wesley
