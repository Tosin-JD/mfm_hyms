Onward Go

1.
Trusting in the Lord thy God,
Onward go!
Holding fast His promised word.
Onward go!
Never deny His worthy name,
Tho’ it bring reproach and shame,
Spreading still His wondrous fame,
Onward go!

2.
Has He call’d thee to the plough?-
Onward go!Night is coming, serve Him now;
Onward go!
Faith and love in service blend;
On His mighty arm depend;
Standing fast until the end.
Onward go!

3.
Has He given thee; golden grain?
Onward go!
Sow. and thou shalt reap again; 
Onward go!
To thy Master's gate repair,
Watching be and waiting there;
He will hear and answer prayer; 
Onward go!

4.
Has He said the end is near?
Onward go!
Serving Him with holy fear.
Onward go!
Christ thy patron, Christ thy stay,
Heavenly bread upon the way;
Onward go!

5.
In this little moment then,
Onward go!
In thy ways acknowledge Him;
Onward go!
Let His mind be found in thee;
Let His will thy pleasure be;
Thus in life and liberty,
Onward go!
