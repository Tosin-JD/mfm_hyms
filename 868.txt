Jesus Only is our Message - 8.7.8.7.D.

1.
Jesus only is our Message,
Jesus all our theme shall be,
We will lift up Jesus ever,
Jesus only will we see.

CHORUS
Jesus only, Jesus ever,
Jesus all in all we sing:
Saviour, Sanctifier, Healer,
Glorious Lord and coming King

2.
Jesus on is our Saviour,
All our guilt He bore awry,
All our righteousness he gives us,
All our strength from day to day.

3.
Jesus is our Sanctifer,
Cleansing us from self and sin.
And with all His Spiritâ€™s fullness.
Filling all our hearts with in

4.
Jesus only is our Healer
All our sicknesses He bare,
And His risen life and fullness,
All His members still may share.

5.
Jesus only is our Power,
His the gift of Pentecost;
Jesus, breathe Thy power upon us.
Fill us with the Holy Ghost.

6.
And for Jesus we are waiting,
Listening for the Advent call,
But 'twill still be Jesus only,
Jesus ever, all in ail.
