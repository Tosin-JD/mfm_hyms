Herongate - L.M.

1.
It is a thing most wonderful,
Almost too wonderful to be.
That God’s own Son should come from heav’n
And die to save a child like me

2.
And yet I know that it is true:
He came to this poor world below.
And wept and toiled and mourned and died.

3.
Only because He loved us so
I cannot tell how He could love
A child so weak and full of sin;
His love must be most wonderful.
If He could die my love to win.

4.
It is most wonderful to know
His love for me so free and sure:
But tis more wonderful to see
My love for Him so faint and poor.

5.
And yet I want to love Thee, Lord:
Oh, light the flame within my heart,
And I will love Thee more and more
unitl I see Thee as Thou art.
