THE KING'S BUSINESS.


1.
I am a stranger here,
within a foreign land
My home is far away,
upon a golden strand;
Ambassador to be
Of realms beyond the sea,
I’m here on business for my King

CHORUS
This is the message that I bring,
a message angels fain would sing;
“Oh, be ye reconciled,
“Thus saith my Lord and King,
“Oh, be ye reconciled to God.”

2.
This is the King's command;
That all men, ev’ry where
Repent and turn away
from sin’s seductive snare;
That all who will obey,
with Him shall reign for aye,
And that’s my business for my King

3.
My home is brighter far
Than Sharon’s rosy plain.
Eternal life and joy thro’outits vast domain;
My Sov’reign bids me tell
how mortals there may dwell,
And that’s my business for my King
