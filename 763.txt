Purer in Heart - 6.4.6.4.6.6.4.4.

1.
Purer in heart, O God, Help me to be;
May I devote my life Wholly to Thee:
Watch Thou my wayward feet,
Guide me with counsel sweet;
Purer in heart Help me to be,

2.
Purer in heart, O God, Help me to be;
Teach me to do Thy will most lovingly:
Be Thou my friend and guide,
Let me with Thee abide;
Purer in heart Help me to be;

3.
Purer in heart, O God, Help me to be;
Until Thy holy face One day I see:
Keep me from secret sin,
Reign Thou my soul within;
Purer in heart Help me to be;

- Mrs. A. L. Davison
