I’ll stand for Christ

1.
In The Army of Jesus we’ve taken our stand,
To fight 'gainst the force of sin,
To the rescue we go, Satan’s power to o’er throw,
And His captives to Jesus we’ll win.

CHORUS
I’ll stand for Christ for Christ alone,
Amid the tempest, tempest and the storm.
Where Jesus leads I’ll follow on;
I’ll stand, I’ll stand for Christ alone.

2.
We go forth not to fight 'gainst the sinner, but sin:
The lost and the outcast we love;
While the claims of our King unto all we will bring,
As we call them His mercy to prove.

3.
Yes, our warfare is great, and our many strong,
Our aim he will ever oppose;
But the battle’s the Lord’s, and to Him we belong,
And with Him we shall conquer our foes.

- Frederick William Fry
