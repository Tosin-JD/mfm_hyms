Landas - C.M. with Refrain

1.
My faith has found a resting place
Not in device or creed;
I trust the Everliving One
His wounds for me shall plead.

CHORUS
I need no other argument,
I need no other plea;
It is enough that Jesus died,
And that He died for me.

2.
Enough for me that Jesus saves
This ends my fear and doubt;
A sinful soul I come to Him
He'll never cast me out.

3.
My heart is leaning on the Word
The written Word of God:
Salvation by my Saviourâ€™s name
Salvation thru His blood.

3.
My great Physician heals the sick
The lost He came to save;
For me His precious blood He shed
For me His life He gave.
