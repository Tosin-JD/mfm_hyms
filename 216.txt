Stephanos -8.5.8.3.

1.
Art thou weary, heavy laden,
Art thou sore distressed?
“Come to Me,” saith One, “and, coming.
Be at rest.

2.
Hath he marks to lead me to Him,
If He be my guide?
“In His feet and hands are wound prints,
And His side.

3.
If I still hold closely to Him,
What hath He at last?
“Sorrow vanquished, labour ended,
Jordan passed.

4.
If I ask Him to receive me,
Will He say me nay?
“Not till earth and not till heaven
Pass away.
