We Are Baptised Unto His Death - C.M.

1.
We are baptised unto His death
By water baptism
And we go down into the grave
Buried with Jesus Christ.

2.
Buried with Christ to sin no more
That we may rise with Him
That we may partake of new grace
That fits us for the skies.

3.
O Holy Ghost, come unto us
That all our words may be
The hope of His soon appearing
And Christ’s revelation.

4.
Lord, let our faith be glorified,
Our joy and crown fulfil;
To live a life of heav’n on earth.
