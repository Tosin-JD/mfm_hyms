Open and let the Master in

1.
Once I heard a sound at my heart’s dark door,
And was roused from the slumberof sin:
It was Jesus knocked, He had knocked before;
Now I said, ‘Blessed Master, come in'

CHORUS
Then open, open, Open, and let the Master in!
For your heart will be bright with the heavenly light
if you’ll only let the Master in.

2.
Then He spread a feast of redeeming love,
And He made me His own happy guest;
In my joy I thought that the saints above
Could be hardly more favoured or blest.

3.
In the holy war with the foes of truth,
He's my Shield; He my table prepares,
He restores my soul, He renews my youth,
And gives triumph in answer to prayers.

4.
He will feast me still with His presence dear,
And the love He so freely hath given;
While His promise tells, as I serve Him here,
Of the banquet of glory in Heaven.
