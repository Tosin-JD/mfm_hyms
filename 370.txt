Surrender - 8.7.8.7. with Refrain

1.
All to Jesus I surrender,
All to Him I freely give;
I will ever love and trust Him,
In His presence daily live.

CHORUS
I surrender all, I surrender all.
All to Thee, my blessed Saviour,
I surrender all.

2.
All to Jesus I surrender,
Humbly at His feet I bow,
Worldly pleasures all forsaken,
Take me, Jesus, take me now.

3.
All to Jesus I surrender,
Lord, I give myself to The;
Fill me with Thy love and power,
Let Thy blessing fall on me.

4.
All to Jesus I surrender,
Now I feel the sacred flame;
0 the joy of full salvation!
Glory, glory to His Name!.
