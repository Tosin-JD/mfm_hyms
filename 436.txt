The Wonderful Story

1.
O sweet is the story of Jesus,
The wonderful Saviour of men,
Who suffered and died for the sinner,
I’ll tell it again and again!

CHORUS
O wonderful, wonderful, story,
The dearest that ever was told;
I’ll repeat It in glory, The wonderful story,
Where I shall His beauty behold.

2.
He came from the brightest of glory;
His blood as a ransom He gave.
To purchase eternal redemption;
And O, He is mighty to save!

3.
His mercy flews on like a river;
His love is unmeasured free;
His grace is forever sufficient.
It reached and purifies me.

- Chas. H. Gabriel
