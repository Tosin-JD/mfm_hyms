Deliverance -10.10.10.10. with Refrain

1.
‘Tis the grandest theme thro’ the ages rung;
Tis the grandest theme for a mortal tongue;
'Tis the grandest theme that world e'er sung:
Our God is able to deliver thee.

CHORUS
He is able to deliver thee,
He is able to deliver thee;
Tho' by sin opprest, Go to Him for rest;
Our God is able to deliver thee.

2.
‘Tis the grandest theme in the earth or main;
‘Tis the grandest theme for a mortal strain;
Tis the grandest theme, tell the world again:
Our God is able to deliver thee.

1.
'Tis the grandest theme, let the tidings roll
To the guilty heart, to the sinful soul;
Look to God in faith, He will make thee whole:
Our God is able to deliver thee.

- William A. Ogden
