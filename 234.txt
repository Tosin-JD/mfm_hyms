Why do you linger

1.
O why do you linger, my brother?
O why do you still stay away?
For you a dear Saviour is waiting
To give you salvation today.

CHORUS
Why do you linger? Why do you linger?
The Saviour is calling today;
O come and believe, Free pardon receive.
And have all your sins washâ€™d away.

2.
To save your poor soul he is yearning,
O come to Him now while you may:
His hand, pierced for you, holds out mercy,
O why not receive it today?

3.
O careless one, great is your danger,
Around you are fetters of sin;
Escape to the only safe refuge,
And Jesus will welcome you in.

4.
O wait not for further conviction,
But come to Him just as you are;
Look up thro' the gloom and the darkness.
To Jesus, the bright Morning Star.
