McComb -8.7.8.7.

1.
This rite our blest Redeemer gave
To all in Him believing;
He leads us through this hallowed wave,
To His example cleaving.

2.
I’ll follow then my glorious Lord,
Whate’er the ties I sever;
He saved my soul, and left His Word
To guide me now and ever.

3.
Jesus, to Thee I yield my all;
In Thy kind arms enfold me;
My heart is fixed, no fears appall,
Thy gracious power shall hold me.

4.
How sweet the way divine to take,
So clear in Jordan’s story;
On souls that follow Christ shall break
The Spirit’s beam of glory.
