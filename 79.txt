Bless The Lord, My Soul

1.
Praise the King of Glory, He is God alone;
Praise Him for the wonders He to us hath shown;
For His promised presence all the pilgrim way,
For the flaming pillar, and the cloud by day.

CHORUS
Praise Him, shining angels, strike your harps of gold;
All His hosts adore Him, who His face behold;
Through His great dominion, while the ages roll,
All His works shall praise Him, all His works shall praise Him,
All His works shall praise Him; bless the Lord, my soul!

2.
Phase Him for redemption, free to evâ€™ry soul;
Praise Him for the Fountain that can make us whole;
For His gifts of kindness and His loving care,
For the blest assurance that He answers prayer.

3.
Praise Him for the trials sent as cords of love,
Binding us more closely to the gins above;
For the faith that conquers, hope that naught can dim,
For the land where loved ones gather unto Him.
