Monks gate - 6.S.6.5.6.6.6.5.

1.
Who honours courage here,
who fights the devil?
who boldly faces fear,
who conquers evil?
We’re not afraid to fight!
we'll scorn the devil’s spite:
Christ gives to us the right
to be his pilgrims.

2.
Some may be terrified
by Satan's testing,
but faith is verified
when we’re resisting.
There’s no discouragement
shall cause us to relent
our firm declared intent
to be his pilgrims.

3.
Though evil powers intend
to break our spirit,
we know we at the end
shall life inherit.
So, fantasies, away!
Why fear what others say?
We’ll labour night and day
to be his pilgrims.

- Michael Saward
