Since Jesus passed by

1.
Like the blind man I wandered,
So lost and undone,
A beggar so helpless,
Without God or His Son;
Then my Saviour in mercy,
heard and answered my cry and
Oh, what a difference since Jesus passed by!

CHORUS
Since Jesus passed by,
Since Jesus passed by,
Oh, what a difference since Jesus passed by!
Well, I can’t explain it, and I cannot tell you why,
but Oh, what a difference, since Jesus passed by!

2.
All my yesterdays are buried
in the deepest of the sea;
That old load of guilt I carried,
is all gone, Praise God, I’m free!
Looking for that bright tomorrow,
where no tears will dim the eye
Well, Oh, what a difference since Jesus passed by!
