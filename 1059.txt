He Whispers Sweet Peace to Me

1.
Sometime when misgivings darken the day,
And faith’s light I cannot see;
I ask my dear Lord to brighten the way,
He whispers sweet peace to me.

CHORUS
Yes, He whispers to me,
He whispers sweet peace to me,
When i am cast down in spirit and soul,
He whispers sweet peace to me.

2.
I could not go on without Him I know,
The world would o'er-whelm my soul;
For I could not see the right way to go.
When temptations o’er me roll.

3.
I trust Him thru faith, by faith hold His hand,
And sometimes my faith is weak,
And then when I ask Him to take command,
It seems that I hear Him speak.

4.
He speaks in a still, small voice we are told,
A voice that dispels all fear;
And when I’m in doubt, or troubled in soul,
That still small voice I can hear.

5.
The trumpet will sound for our Lord’s return,
He's coming for you and me;
I praise His dear name, for this I
now yearn,With Jesus to ever be.
