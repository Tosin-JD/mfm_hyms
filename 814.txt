None but Christ can Satisfy - C.M. with Refrain

1.
O Christ, in Thee my soul hath found,
And found in Thee alone,
The peace, the joy I sought so long,
The bliss till now unknown.

CHORUS
Now none but Christ can satisfy,
None other name for me.
There’s love and life and lasting joy,
Lord Jesus found in Thee.

2.
I sighed for rest and happiness,
I yearn'd for them, not Thee;
But while I passed my Saviour by,
His love laid hold on me.

3.
I tried the broken cisterns, Lord,
But, ah! the waters failed!
E’en as I stooped to drink they fled.
And mocked me as I wailed.

4.
The pleasures lost I sadly mourned,
But never wept for Thee;
Till grace my sightless eyes received,
Thy loveliness to see.

- J. McGranahan
