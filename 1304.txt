St. Agnes-10.10.10.10.

1.
Our blessed Lord, in this Thy presence sweet,
Behold us lowly bending at Thy feet.
Fain would we meet Thee on this hallowed ground
Where ev’ry Blood bought blessing may be found.

1.
Drawn by the strength of Thine own mighty love,
Gladly we come Thy healing touch to prove.
All power is Thine we echo back Thy word
In heaven and earth, Thou never changing Lord.

2.
We grasp Thy promises so sure, so
free,To all who in their weakness call on Thee.
Th’effectual fervent prayer Thou dost receive,
With strength renewing all who dare believe.

3.
Thy servants bless who now before Thee stand,
Who here fulfil the word of Thy command;
And as the anointing oil shall gently flow..
Thy heavenly unction on each life bestow.

4.
As holy hands now minister, with prayer.
May we discern Thy wondrous hands that bear
The marks of Thine affliction for our sake;
And thus in humble faith Thy healing take.

5.
If to Thine eye that pierces deep within
There stands revealed the hidden stain of sin
Still unconfessed, Oh grant us grace that we
May purge our lives afresh and purer be.

6.
Thus joined to Thee our living Head above,
Thy life we share, and in Thy triumph move:
Knit with our fellow members here below,
From strength to strength we shall Thy fulness know.
