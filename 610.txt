WHAT A GATHERING


1.
On that bright and golden morning
when the Son of Man shall come,
And the radiance of His glory we shall see;
When from ev'ry clime and nation
He shall call His people home
What a gath’ring of the ransomed that will be!

CHORUS
What a gath’ring! what a gath’ring!
What a gath’ring of the ransomed
in the summer land of love!
What a gath’ring! what a gath’ring
Of the ransomed in that happy home above!

2.
When the blest who sleep in Jesus
At His bidding shall arise
From the silence of the grave, and from the sea;
And with bodies all celestial
They shall meet Him in the skies
What a gath’ring and rejoicing there will be!

3.
When our eyes behold the City,
with its “many mansions” bright
And its river calm and restful, Flowing free
When the friends that death has parted
shall in bliss again unite
What a gath'ring and a greeting there will be!

4.
Oh, the King is surely coming,
and the time is drawing nigh,
When the blessed day of promisewe shall see;
Then the changing “in a moment,”
“in the twinkling of an eye,”
And for ever in His presence we shall be.

- Fanny. J. Crosby
