Mildred -6.8.6.8.

1.
The happy morn is come:
Triumphant oâ€™er the grave,
The Saviour leaves the tomb;
Omnipotent to save.
Captivity is captive led;
For Jesus liveth, that was dead.

2.
Who now accuses them
For whom their Surety died?
Who now shall those condemn
Whom God hath justified?
Captivity is captive led;
For Jesus liveth, that was dead.

3.
Christ hath the ransom paid;
The glorious work done;
On Him our help is laid;
By Him our victory won.
Captivity is captive led;
For Jesus liveth, that was dead.

- Charles Steggall
