Franconia -S.M.

1.
Blest are the pure in heart,
For thy shall see our God
The secret of the Lord is theirs;
Their soul is Christâ€™s abode.

2.
The Lord, who left the heavens
Our life and peace to bring,
To dwell in lowliness with men,
Their pattern and their King,

3.
Still to the lowly soul
He doth Himself impart,
And for His dwelling and His throne
Chooseth the pure in heart.

4.
Lord, we Thy presence seek;
May ours this blessing be;
Give us a pure and lowly heart,
A temple meet for Thee.

- John Keble
