JESUS IS COMING


1.
Jesus is coming! sing the glad word!
Coming for those He redeem’d by His blood,
Coming to reign as the glorified Lord!
Jesus is coming again!

CHORUS
Jesus is coming, is coming again!
Jesus is coming again!
Shout the glad tidings
O’er mountain and plain! Jesus is coming again!

2.
Jesus is coming! The dead shall arise,
Loved ones shall meet in a joyful surprise,
Caught up together to Him in the skies.
Jesus is coming again!

3.
Jesus is coming! His saints to release;
Coming to give to the warring earth peace:
Sinning, and sighing, and sorrow,shall cease,
Jesus is coming again!

4.
Jesus is coming! the promise is true;
Who are the chosen, the faithful, the few,
Waiting and watching, prepared for review?
Jesus is coming again!
