SAVIOUR, LONG THY SAINTS HAVE WAITED


1.
Saviour, long Thy saints have waited
Centuries have passed away
Since the promise first was given
Of a glorious Advent day
Grey and old the world is growing,
Loud the scoffer’s boast is heard;
But our hearts are peaceful, knowing
We may rest upon Thy word.

CHORUS
“Surely I come quickly!
Surely I come quickly!
Surely I come quickly!”
Amen, Lord Jesus, come!

2.
Lo! the fig-tree buds and blossoms;
Lo! the shadows flee away;
Glad we lift our heads expectant,
Brief will now be Thy delay.
Thou to raise the dead art able,
O’er the grave Thou didst prevail:
Heav'n and earth may prove unstable,
But Thy word can never fail.

3.
Precious, precious parting promise!
Sweetly linger in our ears;
Brightly gleam amid our darkness,
Gently soothe away our fears:
Ever nerve us for the conflict.
Ever fill our souls with joy;
Christ will come and will not tarry
Nothing can our hope destroy.
