Midian - 8.6.8.6.4.

1.
Return, O wanderer, to thy home,
Thy Father calls for thee:
No longer now an exile roam
In guilt and misery: Return, return.

2.
Return, O wanderer, to thy home,
'Tis Jesus calls for thee;
The Spirit and the bride say, Come,
Oh, now for refuge flee: Return, return.

3.
Return, O wanderer, to thy home,
Tis madness to delay:
There are no pardons in the tomb.
And brief is mercy's day: Return, return.

- W. H. Havergal
