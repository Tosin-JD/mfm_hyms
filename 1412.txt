We Lay Down This Foundation, Today - L.M.

1.
We lay down this foundation, today
In Thy name. Lord our God
We beseech Thee our dear Saviour ,
Keep this holy place in Thy car.

2.
And when these Thy people seek Thee
And sinners seek Thee in thishouse ' .
Hear, Almighty from heav’n above
O Lord our God, forgive their sins.

3.
When Thy ministers preach the Word
The gospel of Jesus Thy Son,
Almighty God, in Thy great name
Wrought our wonderful miracles.

4.
And when the little children sing
Their hymns praise unto their king
Let angels join them in His praise
And earth and heav’n lend their chorus. 

5.
'Jehovah will Thou dwell with us
In this our wicked, sinful world?
Jesus Christ will Thou be our King?
Holy Ghost will Thou find rest here?

6.
May Thy glory never depart
From This house that we are building
Make Thy kingdom within our hearts
And establish Thy throne within.
