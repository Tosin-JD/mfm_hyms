Bread Of Life

1.
Here at Thy table, Lord, This sacred hour,
O let us feel Thee near, In loving power;
Calling our thoughts away From self and sin,
As to Thy banquet hall We enter in.

2.
Sit at the feast, dear Lord, Break Thou the bread;
Fill Thou the cup that brings Life to the dead:
That we may find in Thee, Comfort and peace;
And from all sorrow win A full release. '

3.
So shall our life of faith Be full, be sweet;
And we shall find our strength For each day meet:
Fed by Thy living bread. All hungry past,
We shall be satisfied, And saved at last.

4.
Come then, O holy Christ, Feed us, we pray;
Touch with Thy pierced hand Each common day;
Making this earthly life Full of Thy grace,
Till in the home of heav'n We find our place,

- May P. Floty
