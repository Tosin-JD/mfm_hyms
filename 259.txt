Over the Threshold

1.
Step over the threshold, and wander no more,
Oppress'd by the burden of sin;
Step over the threshold: why stand at the door?
The Healer is waiting within.

CHORUS
Then come as thou art; thy poor broken heart
Renewâ€™d by His Spirit shall be:
Step over the threshold: why stand at the door'
Come in, there is mercy for thee.

2.
Step over the threshold: let faith bethy guide
To Him, thy Physician so kind;
Go wash in the fountain that flows from His side,
And health to thy soul thou shalt find.

3.
Step over the threshold, repent and believe,
And quickly thy burdens will fail;
Oh, touch but His garment, and thou shalt receive
The pardon He offers to all.

1.
Step over the threshold, no s helter hast thou;
Thy refuge He offers to be:
Step over the threshold, and come to Him now;
O lost one. He tarries for thee!
