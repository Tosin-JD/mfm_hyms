Saltfleetby All Saints - 8.6.8.6.

1.
In memory of the Saviourâ€™s love
we keep the sacred feast,
where every humble contrite heart
is made a welcome guest.

2.
By faith we take the bread of life
by which our souls are fed,
and drink the token of his blood
that was for sinners shed.

3.
Around his table here we sing
The wonders of his love,
And so anticipate by faith
The heavenly feast above.

- T. Cotterill
