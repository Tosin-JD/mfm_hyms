St. Matthias - 8.8.8 8 8 8.

1.
Jesus, my Lord, my God, my All,
Hear me, blest Saviour, when I call
Hear me, and from Thy dwelling place
Pour down the riches of Thy grace;
Jesus, my Lord, I Thee adore,
Oh make me love Thee more and more.

2.
Jesus, too late I Thee have sought,
How can I love Thee as I ought?
And how extol Thy matchless fame,
The glorious beauty of Thy name?
Jesus, my Lord, I Thee adore,
Oh make me love Thee more and more.

3.
Jesus, what didst Thou find in me,
That Thou hast dealt so lovingly?
How great that joy that Thou hast brought
So far exceeding hope or thought!
Jesus, my Lord, I Thee adore,
Oh make me love Thee more and more.

4.
Jesus, of Thee shall be my song.
To Thee my heart and soul belong,
All that I have or am is Thine,
And Thou, blest Saviour, Thou art mine.
Jesus, my Lord, I Thee adore,
Oh make me love Thee more and more.
