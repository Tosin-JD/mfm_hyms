Philippine - L. M.

1.
O Lord, thy people gathered here
Uplift their joyful hearts as one.
And praise thee, with no thought of fear,
For his bright gift, a life begun.

2.
For thou art seen in every place,
Through all the world thy beauties shine;
But only man may win the grace
To know the inward light of thine.

3.
And so we trace the tender broyy,
And pray these eyes may learn to gaze
Through all this world of here and now
To find thee and to see thy ways.

4.
Praise, Lord, for this sweet world we know
With all the joys thy children share,
And that unknown to which we go,
Both now and ever â€˜neath thy care!

- Mrs. K. E. Roberts
