1.
Waken! Christian children,
Up and let us sing,
With glad voice, the praises
Of our new born King.

2.
Come, nor fear to seek Him,
Children though we be;
Once He said of children,
“Let them come to Me."

3.
In a manger lowly,
Sleeps the heavenly Child;
O’er Him fondly bendeth
Mary, mother mild.

4.
Far above that stable,
Up in heaven so high,
One bright star out-shineth,
Watching silently.

5.
Fear not then to enter,
Though we cannot bring
Gold, or myrrh, or incense
Fitting for a King.

6.
Gifts He asketh richer,
Offerings costlier still,
Yet may Christian children
Bring them if they will.

7.
brighter than all jewels
’Chines the modest eye;
Best of gifts He loveth
Child-like purity.

8.
Haste we then to welcome
With a joyous lay
Christ the King of Glory,
Born for us today.
