Grace sufficient for thee

1.
They that trust in the Lord are secure.
Tho’ the storm rages dark o’er-the sea;
For this anchor of promise is sure
“My grace is sufficient for thee.”

CHORUS
“My grace is sufficient for thee,”
“My grace is sufficient for thee”
Oh, matchless, boundless grace of God,
“My grace is sufficient for thee!”

2.
What a boon to the pilgrim opprest,
What a balm such a promise must be
To the laden ones seeking for rest,
“My grace is sufficient for thee.”

3.
In the race for the prize, fainting soul.
Though aweary you bow down the knee.
Rise again, and press on the goal
“My grace is sufficient for thee.”

4.
Neither trial nor doubt brings dismay.
Nor from danger that comes will I flee;
For I stand on this promise today
"My grace is sufficient for thee ”
