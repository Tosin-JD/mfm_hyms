Oaksville - C. M.

1.
Jesus, Thine all victorious love
Shed in my heart abroad;
Then shall my feet no longer rove,
Rooted and fixed in God.

2.
O that in me the sacred fire
Might now begin to glow!
Burn up the dross of base desire.
And make the mountains flow,

3.
Thou who at Pentecost didst fall.
And all my sins consume!
Come, Holy Ghost, for Thee I call,
Spirit of burning, come!

4.
Refining fire, go through my heart,
illuminate my soul;
Scatter Thy life thro’ ev’ry part,
And sanctify the whole.

5.
My steadfast soul, from falling free,
Shall then no longer move;
While Christ is all the world to me.
And all my heart is love.

- Charles Wesley
