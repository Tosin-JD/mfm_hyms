Let Jesus Come into Your Heart

1.
If you are tired of the load of your sin,
Let Jesus come into your heart;
If you desire a new life to begin,
Let Jesus come into your heart.

CHORUS
Just now your doubtings give oâ€™er,
Just now reject Him no more;
Just now throw open the door
Let Jesus come into your heart.

2.
If 'tis for purity now that you sigh,
Let Jesus come into your heart;
Fountains for cleansing are flowin near by,
Let Jesus come into your heart.

3.
If there's a tempest your voice cannot still,
Let Jesus come into your heart.
If there's a void this world never can fill,
Let Jesus come into your heart.

4.
If you would join the glad songs of the blest,
Let Jesus come into your heart.
If you would enter the mansions of rest,
Let Jesus come into your heart.
