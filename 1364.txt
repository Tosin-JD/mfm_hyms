1.
Hark, the voice of Jesus calling,
“Who will go and work today?
Fields are white, and harvest waiting,
Who will bear the sheaves away?"
Loud and long the Master calleth,
Rich reward He offers free.
Who will answer, gladly saying,
“Here am I, send me, send me?"

2.
If you cannot cross the ocean
And the heathen lands explore,
You can find the needy nearer,
You can help those at your door;
If you cannot give the thousands.
You can give the widow's mite.
And the least you do for Jesus
Will be precious in His sight

3.
If you cannot sing like angels,
If you cannot preach like Paul,
You can tell the love of Jesus.
You can say He died for all;
If you cannot rouse the wicked,
With the judgement’s dread alarms,
You can lead the little children
To the Saviour’s waiting arms.

4.
Let none hear you idly saying,
'There is nothing I can do,"
While the souls of men are dying,
And the Master palls for you;
Take the task He gives you gladly,
Let His work your pleasure be,
Answer quickly while He calleth,
"Here am I, send me, send me.”
