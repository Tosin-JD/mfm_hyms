Rest In the Lord

1.
Rest in the Lord, O weary, heavy laden!
Look unto Him your ever present Guide;
Rest in the Lord, whose Word is truth eternal;
Leave all to Him, whatever may betide.

2.
Rest in the Lord, and tell Him all your sorrow;
Trust in His love, so boundless, full, and free;
He will not leave, nor will He eâ€™er forsake you;
Rest in the Lord, and sweet your rest shall be.

3.
Rest in the Lord, and when your toil is over,
When ev'ry storm and danger you have pass'd
Lo! He has said, whose Word abideth ever,
You shall receive His welcome home at last,
