Worthy art Thou

1.
Worthy of praise is Christ our Redeemer,
Worthy of glory, honour and pow’r!
Worthy of all our soul’s adoration,

CHORUS
Worthy art Thou! Worthy art Thou!
Worthy of riches, blessings and honour,
Worthy of wisdom, glory and pow’r!
Worthy of earth and heaven’s thanks giving,
Worthy art Thou! Worthy art Thou!

2.
Lift up the voice in praise and devotion,
Saints of all earth before Him
should bow;Angels in heaven worship Him, saying,

3.
Lord, may we come before Thee with singing,
Filled with Thy Spirit, wisdom and pow’r;
May we ascribe Thee glory and honour,

- Tillit S. Teddlie
