St. Agnes - C. M.

1.
Happy the home when God is there 
And love fills every one,
When with united work and prayer
The Master’s will is done.

2.
Happy the home where God’s strong love Is 
starting to appear,
Where all the children hear His fame
And parents hold Him dear.

3.
Happy the home where prayer is heard
And praise is everywhere,
Where parents love the sacred Word
And its true wisdom share.

4.
Lord, let us in our homes agree
This blessed peace to gain;
Unite our hearts in love to Thee,
And love to all will reign.

- Henry Ware, Jr.
