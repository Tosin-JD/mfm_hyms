HE IS COMING AGAIN


1.
Lift up your head, pilgrims aweary!
See day’s approach now crimson the sky;
Night shadows flee, and your Beloved,
Awaited with longing, at last draweth nigh.

CHORUS
He is coming again,
He is coming again,
The very same Jesus rejected of men;
He is coming again, He is comingagain,
With pow’r and great glory,
He is coming again!

2.
Dark was the night sin warred
against us!
Heavy the load of sorrow we bore;
But now we see signs of His coming
Our hearts glow within us,
joy’s cup runneth o’er!

3.
0 blessed hope! O blissful promise!
Filling our hearts with rapture divine;
O day of days! Hail Thy appearing!
Thy transcendent glory for ever shall shine!

4.
Even so, come, precious Lord Jesus!
Creation waits redemption to see;
Caught in clouds, soon we shall meet Thee
O blessed assurance, for ever with Thee!
