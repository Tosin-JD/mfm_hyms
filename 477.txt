Hermas - 6.5.6.5.D. and Refrain

1.
“Welcome, happy morning,” Age to age shall say;
Hell today is vanquished. Heaven is won today!
Lo! the dead is living: God forever more,
Him, their true Creator, All His works adore.

CHORUS
“Welcome, happy morning,"
Age to age shall say;
Hell today is vanquished,
Heav'n is won today.

2.
Earth her joy confesses, Clothing her for spring,
All good gifts returned with Her returning King,
Bloom in every meadow, Leaves on every bough
Speak His sorrows ended, Hail His triumph now.

3.
Come then, true and faithful, Now fulfil Thy word,
‘Tis Thine own third morning, Rise,
O buried Lord!
Show Thy face in brightness, Bid the nations see,
Bring again our daylight: Day returns with Thee!

- Venantius Fortunatus
