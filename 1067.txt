There Is A Wondrous Ringing

1.
I here is a wondrous ringing as from a silver bell
And In my heart it's singing.

CHORUS
'Tis well with me, yes it is well, Oh.
melody from heaven thy sound
forever may swell
Sweet comfort hast Thou given;
'Tis well with me, yes it is well.

2.
It weaves a soft enchantment
and casts a magic spell
it fills me with contentment.
T I feel the strong protection,
Itâ€™s more than words can tell
If I stay in connection.
