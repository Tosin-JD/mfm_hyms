It’s Just Like Him

1.
Oh, I love to read of Jesus and His love,
How He left His Father’s mansion far above;
How He came on earth to live,
How He came His life to give
Oh, I love to read of Jesus and His love!

CHORUS
“It’s just like Him” to take my sins away.
To make me glad and free, to keep
me day by day ;“It’s just like Him" to give His life for me,
That I might go to heaven, and ever with Him be.

2.
Oh, I love to read of Jesus as He went
Ev’rywhere, to do His Father’s will intent;
How He gave the blind their sight.
How He gave the wrong’d ones right,
How He swift deliv’rance to the captive sent.

3.
Oh, I love to read of Jesus on the tree,
For it shows how great the love that died for me;
And the blood that from His side
Flow'd, when on the cross He died,
Paid my debt, and evermore doth make me free

4.
Oh, my dear and precious Saviour, at Thy feet
Here I give my self and all I have complete;
I will serve Thee all my days
With a heart all fill’d with praise,
And I’ll thank Thee face to face when we shall meet.
