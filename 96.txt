What Shall I Render To My God - C.M.

1.
What shall I render to my God
For all His mercy's store?
I’ll take gifts He hath bestowed,
And humbly ask for more.

2.
The sacred cup of saving grace
I will with thanks receive,
And all his promises embrace,
And to His glory live.

3.
My vows I will to his great name
Before His people pay,
And all I have and all I am
Upon His altar lay.

4.
Thy lawful servant, Lord, I owe
To Thee whate’er is mine,
Born in Thy family below
And by redemption Thine.

5.
Thy hands created me, Thy hands
From sin have set me free,
Offer the sacrifice of praise
And call upon His name.

6.
Praise Him, ye saints, the God of love,
Who hath my sins forgiven,
Till, gathered to the church above,
We sing the songs of heaven.
