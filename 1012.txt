It’s Not an Easy Road

1.
It’s not an easy road we are trav’ling to Heaven,
For many are the thorns on the way;
It’s not an easy road but the Saviour is with us,
His presence gives us joy ev’ry day.

CHORUS
No, no, it’s not an easy road,
No, no, it’s not an easy road;
But Jesus walks with me and
brightens my journey,
And lightens ev'ry heavy load.

2.
It's not an easy road
There are trials and troubles,
And many are the dangers we meet;
But Jesus guards and keeps
So that nothing can harm us,
And smooth the rugged path for our feet.

3.
Though I am often footsore and weary from travel,
Though I am often bowed down with care;
A better day is coming when Home in the glory,
We’ll rest in perfect peace over there.
