Albano - C. M.

1.
Immortal Love, forever full,
For ever flowing free,
For ever shared, for ever whole,
A never ebbing sea!

2.
We may not climb the heavenly steeps
To bring the Lord Christ down:
In vain we search the lowest deeps,
For Him no depths can drown.

3.
But warm, sweet, tender even yet
A present help is He;
And faith has still its Olivet,
And love its Galilee.

4.
The healing of His seamless dress
Is by our beds of pain;
We touch Him in life’s throng and press,
And we are whole again.

5.
O Lord and Master of us all,
Whate’er our name or sign,
We own Thy sway, we hear Thy call,
We test our lives by Thine.

- J. G. Whittier.
