Chichester - C. M.

1.
Talk with us, Lord, Thyself reveal.
While here o’er earth we rove;
Speak to our hearts, and let us feel
The kindling of Thy love.

2.
With Thee conversing we forget
All time and toil and care;
Labour is rest and pain is sweet,
If Thou, my God, art here

3.
Here then, my God, vouchsafe to
stay,
And bid my heart rejoice:
My bounding heart shall own Thy
sway,
And echo to Thy voice.

4.
Let this mine every hour employ,
Till I Thy glory see,
Enter into my Master’s joy,
And find my heaven In Thee.

- Charles Wesley
