A New Name In Glory

1.
I was once a sinner, but I came
Pardon to receive from my Lord:
This was freely given and I found
That He always kept His word.

CHORUS
There’s a new name written down in glory,
And it’s mine, O yes, it’s mine!
And the white-robed angels sing the story,
“A sinner has come home.”
For there’s a new name written in glory,
And it’s mine, O yes, it’s mine!
With my sins forgiven I am bound
for heaven,Never more to roam.

2.
I was humbly kneeling at the cross.
Fearing naught but God’s angry frown;
When the heavens opened and I saw
That my name was written down.

3.
In the Book ‘tis written “Saved by Grace,"
O the joy that came to my soul!
Now I am forgiven and I know
By the blood I am made whole.
