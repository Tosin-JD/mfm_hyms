Gott des Himmels - 8.7.8.7.7.7.

1.
Now the morn new light is pouring:
Lord, may we our spirits raise,
Through Thy grace our souls restoring;
So, on Thy great day of days,
We with joy its dawn may meet
Fearless at the mercy-seat.

2.
Jesus, who our steps art guiding
By Thy wordâ€™s celestial light,
Now and evermore abiding,
Our defence, our rock of might:
Nowhere, save alone in Thee,
Can we rest from danger free.

3.
Lo! we yield to Thy direction
Soul and body, heart and mind;
Keep Thou all by Thy protection
To Thy mighty hand resigned.
Thee our glorious God we own;
Let us, Lord, be Thine alone.

- H. Albert
