My Hope Is In The Lord

1.
My hope is in the Lord Who gave Himself for me,
And paid the price of all my sin at Calvary.

CHORUS
For me He died, For me He lives,
And everlasting life and light He freely gives.

2.
No merit of my own His anger to suppress.
My only hope is found in Jesus’ righteousness.

3.
And now for me He stands Before the Father’s throne.
He shows His wounded hands, and names me as His own.

4.
His grace has planned it all. Tis mine but to believe,
And recognize His work of love and Christ receive.
