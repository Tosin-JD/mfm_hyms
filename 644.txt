644
Living By Faith

1.
I care not today what the morrow may bring,
'If shadow or sunshine or rain,
The Lord I know ruleth o’er every thing,
And all of my worry is vain

CHORUS
Living by faith, in Jesus above,
Trusting, confiding in His great love.
From all harm safe in His sheltering arm,
I’m living by faith and fee) no alarm.

2.
Tho’ tempests may blow and the storm clouds arise,
Obscuring the brightness of life,
I’m never alarmed at the overcast skies,
The Master looks on at the strife.

3.
I know that He safely will carry me thru,
No matter what evils betide,
Why should I then care tho’ the tempest may blow,
If Jesus walks close to my side.

4.
Our Lord will return in the clouds some sweet day,
Our troubles will then all be o’er,
The Master so gently will lead us away,
Beyond the blest heavenly shore.
