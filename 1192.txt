Moseley - 6.6.6.6.

1.
I hunger and I thirst;
Jesu, my manna be:
Ye living waters, burst
Out of the rock for me

2.
Thou bruised and broken Bread,
My life-long wants supply;
As living souls are fed,
Oh feed me, or I die.

3.
Thou true life-giving Vine,
Let me Thy sweetness prove;
Renew my life with Thine,
Refresh my soul with love.

4.
Rough paths my feet have trod,
Since first their course began;
Feed me, Thou Bread of God;
Help me. Thou Son of Man.

5.
For still the desert lies
My thirsting soul before;
0 living waters, rise
Within me evermore.

- Henry Smart
