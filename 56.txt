Russian Hymn - 11.10.11.9.

1.
God the almighty One! wisely ordaining
Judgements unsearchable, famine and sword;
Over the tumult of war Thou art reigning:
Give to us peace in our time, O Lord!

2.
God the all merciful earth hath forsaken
Thy ways of blessedness, slighted Thy Word;
Bid not Thy wrath in its terrors awaken:
Give to us peace in our time, O Lord!

3.
God the all righteous One! man hath defied Thee;
Yet to eternity standeth Thy Word;
Falsehood and wrong shall not tarry beside Thee:
Give to us peace in our time, O Lord!

- Henry F. Chorley
