Who Will Join Us

1.
Behold the armies of the King
Are marching forth in line;
Their royal banners lifted high,
In radiant splendour shine.

CHORUS
Who will join us, who will join us,
Who will join us in the fray?
Who will join us, who will join us,
Who will join our ranks today?

2.
And now among the foremost ranks,
Where foe meets foe today,
They stand erect with sword and shield,
To brave the dread affray.

3.
Behold, the King Himself is near,
And while His own advance,
The traitor legions backward fall
Beneath their fearless glance.

4.
Oh, glorious, glorious victory,
With lifeâ€™s great battle done;
The cross laid down, they wear the crown,
Their faith in Christ hath won.
