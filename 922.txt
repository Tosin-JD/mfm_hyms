Bunyan -6.5.6.5.6.6.6.5.

1.
Christian, unflinching stand, Satan defying!
Outstreched is God’s right hand,
All power supplying;
Valiant as saints of old,
Proudly the cross uphold,
Moved by His love untold
To live for Jesus

2.
Stern is your fight with wrong;
Christ stands beside you.
Hard grows the way and long;
His hand will guide you.
Calmly each danger face,
Boldly His footsteps trace,
Seeking by God’s good grace
To live for Jesus.

1.
Friends by your side may fall;
Help and defend them.
Foes in distress may call;
Comfort and tend them.
Give ear to them that plead;
Bind up the hearts that bleed;
Learn by each kindly deedTo live for Jesus.
