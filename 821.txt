Dominica-S.M.

1.
Riches unsearchable
In Jesus' love we know;
And pleasures, springing from the well
Of life, our souls oâ€™erflow.

2.
The spirit we receive
Of wisdom, grace, and power;
And always sorrowful We live,
Rejoicing evermore.

3.
Angels our servants are,
And keep in all our ways,
And in their watchful hands they bear
The sacred sons of grace:

4.
Unto that heavenly bliss
They all our steps attend;
And God Himself our Father is,
And Jesus is our Friend.

- Charles Wesley
