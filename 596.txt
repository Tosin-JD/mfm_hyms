596
Watch ye, Therefore

1.
Watch, earnestly watch,
The Lord’s approach is nearing;
Pray, fervently pray,
No man can know the hour;
Like as a thief at night is His appearing;
He cometh to judge the world in truth and power.

CHORUS
Watch ye. pray ye, soldiers of the Lord;
Work ye, wait ye, trusting in His word;
Keep His commandments, and His law obey,
And He will reward you in the last great day.

2.
Work, joyfully work,
All ye who know His chast’ning;
Wait, patiently wait,
For your reward is nigh;Lift up your heads,
the day of rest is hast’ning;
Rest, glorious rest, with Jesus by and by.

3.
Trust, loyally trust,
And as to Him thou'rt clinging,
Keep, faithfully keep
The Saviour’s blest commands;
Then in thy heart the blest assurance ringing,
Know surely thy name is written in His hands.
