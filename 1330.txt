Everton - 8.7.8.7.D.

1.
Lord, your church on earth is seeking
power and wisdom from above:
teach us all the art of speaking
with the accents of your love.
We will heed your great commission
sending us to every place
'Go, baptize, fulfil my mission;
serve with love and share my grace!’

2.
You release us from our bondage,
lift the burdens caused by sin;
give new hope, new strength and courage,
grant release from fears within.
Light for darkness, joy for sorrow,
love for hatred, peace for strife
these and countless blessings follow
as the Spirit gives new life.

3.
In the streets of every city
where the bruised and lonely live,
we will show the Saviour’s pity
and his longing to forgive.
In all lands and with all races
we will serve, and seek to bring
all mankind to render praises
Christ, to you, redeemer king.
