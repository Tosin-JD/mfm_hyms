There’s A Peace In My Heart That The World Never Gave

1.
There’s a peace in my heart that the world never gave,
A peace it can not take away:
Though the trials of life may surround like a cloud.
I’ve a peace that has come there to stay.

CHORUS
Constantly abiding Jesus is mine:
Constantly abiding rapture divine:
He never leaves me lonely whispers, O so kind:
“I will never leave thee,” Jesus is mine.

2.
All the world seemed to sing of a Saviour and King,
When peace sweetly came to my heart;
Troubles all fled away and my night turned to day,
Blessed Jesus, how glorious Thou art!

3.
This treasure I have in a temple of clay.
While here on His footstool I roam;
But He’s coming to take me some glorious day,
Over there to my heavenly home!

- Anne S. Murphy (1908)
