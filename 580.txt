Old 112th - 8.8.8.8.8.8.

1.
O quickly come dread Judge of all;
For, awful though thine advent be,
All shadows from the truth will fall,
and falsehood die, in sight of thee:
O quickly come! For doubt and fear
Like clouds dissolve when thou art near.

2.
O quickly come, great King of all;
Reign all around us, and within;
Let sin no more our souls enthral,
Let pain and sorrow die with sin:
O quickly come! for thou alone
Canst make thy scattered people one.

3.
O quickly come, true Life of all;
For death is mighty all around;
On every home his shadows fall,
On every heart his mark is found:
O quickly come! for grief and pain
Can never cloud thy glorious reign.

4.
O quickly come, sure Light of all,
For gloomy night broods oâ€™er our way
And weakly souls begin to fall
With weary watching for the day:
O quickly corne! for round thy throne
No eye is blind, no night is known.
