Redhead C.M.

1.
In all ways chosen by the Lord
My journey will I go
Prevent me not ye Holy men
I will follow thee there

2.
If Jesus moves in the furnace
I will follow Him there
Prevent me not will be my word
If the world oppose me

3. 
In adoration, temptation
With thy Command I'll go
Prevent me not, for I will go
Unto Emmanuel.

4.
And when my Saviour shall call me
And still my cry shall be
Prevent me not, death is coming
I will follow with joy.

- R. Redhead
