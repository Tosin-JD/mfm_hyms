He will answer every pray’r
This, His promise and His will
He has never chang'd nor fail'd
Glory to His name.

He will answer every pray'r
To His promise I will cling
I know He'll ne'er deceive me.
Glory to His name.

3.
He will answer every pray'r
Let us ask from him in faith
With His Holy Spirit's help
Glory to His name.

4.
He will answer every pray’r
Come thou to the mercy seat
Blest assurance you'll receive
Glory to His name.
