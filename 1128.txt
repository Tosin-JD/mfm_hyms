1128
I’ve a friend

1.
Tho' the world allure with its gilded charm,
I’m a child of God whom it cannot harm;
He will me uphold by his mighty
armEv’ry moment of my day.

CHORUS
I’ve a friend who will ev’ry need supply
I’ve a home far beyond the starry sky,
And you know, ;hat is just the reason why
I am singing Hallelujah!

2.
I can ne'er forget how upon the tree
Laid the Son of God, there to die for me;
Yet to save my soul, thus it had to be,
There could be no other way.

3.
I would e’er be true to my Lord and King,
Ev’ry waking hour praises to him sing,
Knowing that at last he my soul shall bring
Evermore with him to stay.
