Toiling for Jesus

1.
Gladly, gladly toiling for the Master,
Go we forth with willing hands to do,
Whatsoe’er to us He hath appointed,
Faithfully our mission we’ll pursue

CHORUS
Toiling for Jesus,
Joyfully we go, joyfully we go;
Toiling for Jesus,
In His vineyard here below.
Sweetly, sweetly we will tell the stray
Of His love to mortals here below;
Christ, the brightness of the Father’s glory,
Freely here His blessing wilt bestow.

2.
Meekly, meekly toiling for the Master,
Walking, faithfully the path He trod;
Leading wand'rers to the dear Redeemer,
Pointing sinners to the Lamb of God.
