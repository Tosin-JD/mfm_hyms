Quam dilecta - 6.6.6.6.

1.
We love the place, O God,
Wherein Thine honour dwells,
The joy of Thine abode
All earthly joy excels.

2.
We love the house of prayer,
Wherein Thy servants meet;
And Thou, O Lord, art there
Thy chosen flock to greet.

3.
We love the sacred font,
For there the Holy Dove
Pours out, as He is wont,
His blessing from above.

4.
We love the word of life,
The word that tells of peace,
Of comfort in the strife,
And joys that never cease.

5.
We love our Fatherâ€™s board,
O what' on earth so dear?
Where faithful hearts, O Lord,
Still find Thy presence near.

6.
We love to sing below
for mercies freely given;
But O! we long to know
The triumph-song of heaven

7.
Lord Jesus, give us grace
On earth to love Thee more.
In heaven to see Thy face,
And with Thy saints adore.
