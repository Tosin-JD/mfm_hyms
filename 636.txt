Venting-11.11.11.10. with Refrain

1.
Like radiant sunshine that comes after rain,
Like beautiful rest after sorrow and pain,
Like hope that Is kindled returning again
Is the wonderful peace of my Saviour.

CHORUS
Wonderful peace, beautiful peace,
Wonderful peace of my Saviour;
Thereâ€™s nothing on earth can such gladness impart
As this wonderful peace of my Saviour.

2.
So soft and refreshing, as sweet as the dew,
A promise that cannot be broken to you;
A light that will shine ail the long journey thro
Is the wonderful peace of my Saviour.

3.
It brightens earth's darkness and banishes care
And helps you to carry the burden you bear;
A refuge in trouble, your sorrows to share,
Is the wonderful peace of my Saviour.

4.
A guardian in danger where evil isrife,
A mighty defender in conflict and strife,
A beautiful guide to that heavenly life
Is the wonderful peace of my Saviour.
