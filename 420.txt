Stepping in the light

1.
Trying to walk in the steps of the Saviour,
Trying to follow our Saviour and King,
Shaping our lives by His blessed example.
Happy, how happy, the songs that we bring.

CHORUS
How beautiful to walk in the steps of the Saviour,
Stepping in the light, Stepping in the light;
How beautiful to walk in the steps of the Saviour,
Led in paths of light.

2.
Pressing more closely to Him who is leading
When we are tempted to turn from the way,
Trusting the arm that is strong todefend us.
Happy, how happy, our praises each day.

3.
Walking in footsteps of gentle forbearance,
Footsteps of faithfulness, mercy and love,
Looking to Him for the grace freely promised,
Happy, how happy, our journey above.

4.
Trying to walk in the steps of the Saviour,
Upward, still upward weâ€™ll follow our Guide;
When we shall see Him, the King in His beauty,
Happy, how happy, our place at His side.-Eliza E. Hewitt
