Carson -7.7.8.7. and Refrain

1.
Seal us, O Holy Spirit,
Grant us Thine impress, we pray;
We would be more like the Saviour,
Stamped with His image today.

CHORUS
Seal us, seal us,
Seal us just now, we pray;
Seal us, O Holy Spirit,
Seal us for service today.

2.
Seal us, O Holy Spirit,
Help us Thy likeness to show;
Then from our life unto others
Streams of rich blessings shall flow.

3.
Seal us, O Holy Spirit,
Make us Thine own from this hour;
Let us be useful, dear Master,
Seal us with witnessing power.
