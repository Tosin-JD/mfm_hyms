My Burdens Rolled Away

1.
I remember when my burdens rolled away.
I had carried them for years, night and day;
When I sought the blessed Lord,
and I took Him at His word,
Then at once all my burdens rolled away.

CHORUS
Rolled away, rolled away
I am happy since my burdens rolled away:
Rolled away, rolled away,
I am happy since my burdens rolled away.

2.
I remember when my burdens rolled away.
That I feared would never leave night or day;
Jesus showed to me the loss, 
so I left them at the cross;
I was glad when my burdens rolled away.

3.
I remember when my burdens rolled away,
That had hindered me for years, night and day;
As I sought the throne of grace, 
just a glimpse of Jesus’ face,
And I knew that my burdens could not stay.

4.
I am singing since my burdens rolled away.
There’s a song within my heart night and day;
I am living for my King, and with joy
I shout and sing
Hallelujah! all my burdens rolled away.
