Come on the Wings of the Morning

1.
Come on the wing of the morning;
Come, Thou Redeemer and King;
Hail to the day that is dawning,
Hail to the joy it will bring.

CHORUS
Oh, come on the wings of the morning!
Oh, come on our hearts as wesing!
Come as we sing in the day that is dawning;
Oh, come Thou Redeemer and King!

2.
Come on the wings of the morning;
Come with Thy glory and grace,
All of Thy promise performing,
Showing the light of Thy face.

3.
Come on the wings of the morning;
Come with a joyful surprise,
Lifting the sad and the mourning,
Wiping the tears from their eyes.

4.
Come on the wings of the morning;
Come as the King to Thy throne;
Have we not sounded Thy warning;
Now let Thy glory be known.
