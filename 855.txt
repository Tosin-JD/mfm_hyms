1.
Rejoice, for Jesus reigns
Enthroned in human hearts
He breaks the prison chains
And makes them free indeed,
The devil might God's child oppose

2.
The work of righteousness.
Tidings of truth and peace;
For comfort in our life
Shall spread all round about
Gentiles and Jews shall all bow down
And will worship acceptably

3.
There’s pow’r with Thee for the
Protection of Thine own;
And to Thy high decree
Shall millions take heed to
The heav'ns rejoice to see Thy work
The islands far hearThy command.

4.
This perfect heav'nly seed
shall grow to a big trees;
Like the blessed leaven
Shall spread all o'er the earth;
Till God the son comes back again
It will go on, Amen, Amen.
