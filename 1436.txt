Where Shall I Be

1.
When judgement day is drawing nigh,
Where shall I be?
When God the works of men shall try.
Where shall I be?
When east and west the fire shall roll,
Where shall I be?
How will it be with my poor soul?
Where shall I be?

CHORUS
O where shall I be when the first trumpet sounds,
O where shall I be when it sounds so loud?
When it sounds so loud as to wake up the dead?
O where shall I be when it sounds?

2.
When wicked men his wrath shall see,
Where shall I be?
And to the rocks and mountains flee,
Where shall I be?
When hills and mountains flee away.
Where shall I be?
When all the works of men decay.
Where shall I be?

3.
When heav'n and earth as some great scroll,
Where shall I be?
Shall from God's angry presence roll,
Where shall I be?
When all the saints redeem’d shall stand,
Where shall l be?
For ever blest at God’s right hand,
Where shall l be?

4.
All trouble done, all conflict past.
Where shall I be?
And old A poll you slain at last,
Where shall l be?
When Christ shall reign from shore to shore,
Where shall I be?
And peace abide forever more,
Where shall I be?
