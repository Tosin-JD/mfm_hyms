Balm in Gilead • Irregular

1.
Sometimes I feel discouraged.
And think my work’s in vain,
But then the Holy Spirit
Revives my soul again.

CHORUS
There is a balm in Gilead
to make the wounded whole;
There is balm in Gilead
to heal the sin sick soul.


2.
If you cannot preach like Peter,
If you cannot pray like Paul,
You can tell he love of Jesus,
And say, “He died for all.”
