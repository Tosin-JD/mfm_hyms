St. Hugh - C. M.

1.
Lord, teach us how to pray aright,
With reverence and with fear;
Though dust and ashes in Thy - sight,
We may, we must, draw near.

2.
We perish if we cease from prayer;
O grant us power to pray!
And when to meet Thee we prepare,
Lord, meet us by the way.

3.
God of all grace, we come to Thee,
With broken, contrite heart;
Give what Thine eye delights to Â» see,
Truth in the inward part;

4.
Faith in the only sacrifice
That can for sin atone.
To cast our hopes, to fix our eyes,
On Christ, on Christ alone;

5.
Patience to watch and wait and weep,
Though mercy long delay;
Courage our fainting souls to keep.
And trust Thee though Thou slay.

6.
Give these, and then Thy will be done;
Thus strengthened with ell might,
We through Thy Spirit and Thy Son
shall pray, and pray aright.
