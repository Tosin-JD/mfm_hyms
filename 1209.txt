The Holy Communion - P. M.

1.
The Holy Communion
The grace of God it is
To eat the bread and drink the wine
In remembrance of Thee.

CHORUS
In remembrance of that feast We are gathered today
To show the Lord’s coming back again.
Until He will come back again. 
Until My (Until my Father’s kingdom on high)

2.
Before I. (Before I drink with you once again)
This is our type of passover feast Time of deliverance is
When, I by faith, cling to that shed blood. I shall freedom receive
Sickness and need shall flee, Satan’s army may rise
We shall conquer them all.

3.
The blood that flowed for sin
We see, in this, the type
It is a witness in our heart
That Thou really loves us.

4.
This little type of feast,
If it is here so sweet
How sweeter still in heav'n above
When we shall see Thy face.
