Angelsâ€™ Song - L.M.

1.
O Breath of God, breathe on us now.
And move within us while we pray;
The spring of our new life art Thou,
The very light of our new day.

2.
O strangely art Thou with us. Lord,
Neither in height nor depth to seek:
In nearness shall Thy voice be heard:
Spirit to spirit Thou dost speak.

3.
Christ is our advocate on high;
Thou art our advocate within:
O plead the truth, and make reply
To every argument of sin.
4.
But ah, this faithless heart of mine!
The way I know; I know my guide:
Forgive me, O my Friend divine,
That I so often turn aside.

5.
Be with me when no other friend
The mystery of my heart can share;
And be Thou known, when fears transcend,
By Thy best name of Comforter.

- A. H. Vine
