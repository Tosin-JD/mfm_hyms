1.
The God of love my shepherd is,
And he that doth me feed;
While he is mine and I am his,
What can I want or need?

2.
He leads me to the tender grass,
Where I both feed and rest;
Then to the streams that gently pass:
In both I have the best.

3.
Or if I stray, he doth convert,
And bring my mind in frame.
And all this not for my desert,
But for his holy name.

4.
Yea, in deathâ€™s shady black abode
Well may I walk, not fear;
For thou art with me, and thy rod
To guide, thy staff to bear.

5.
Surely thy sweet and wondrous love
Shall measure all my days;
And, as it never shall remove,
So neither shall my praise.

- George Herbert
