Rejoice And be Glad - Irregular

1.
Rejoice and be glad! 
the Redeemer hath come:
Go, look on His cradle, 
His cross, and His tomb.

CHORUS
Sound His praises, tell the story of
Him who was slain:
Sound His praises, tell with gladness
He liveth again.

2.
Rejoice and be glad! 
it is sunshine at last;
The clouds have departed, the
shadows are past.

3.
Rejoice and be glad! 
For the blood hath been shed;
Redemption is finished, 
the price hath been paid.

4.
Rejoice and be glad! now the
pardon is free;
The just for the unjust hath died on
the tree.

5.
Rejoice and be glad!
for the Lamb that was slain,
Oâ€™er death is triumphant,
and liveth again.

6.
Rejoice and be glad!
for our King is on high;
He pleadeth for us on 
His throne in the sky.

7.
Rejoice and be glad!
for He cometh again;
He cometh in glory, 
the Lamb that was slain.

- Horatius Bonar
