O for a closer walk with God

1.
O for a closer walk with God,
A calm and heavâ€™nly frame,
A light to shine upon the road
That leads me to the Lamb!

2.
Where is the blessedness I knew
When first I saw the Lord?
Where is the soul refreshing view
Of Jesus and His word?

3.
What peaceful hours I then enjoyed!
How sweet their memory still!
But they have left an aching void
The world can never fill.

4.
Return, O Holy Dove, return,
Sweet Messenger of rest;
I hate the sins that made Thee mourn,
And drove Thee from my breast.

- William Cowper
