Marion - S.M. with Refrain

1.
Rejoice, ye pure in heart,
Rejoice, give thanks, and sing.
Your festival banner wave on high,
The cross of Christ your King.CHORUS
Rejoice rejoice, Rejoice,
give thanks, and sing!

2.
With all the angel choirs,
With all the saints on earth,
Pour out the strains of joy and bliss,
True rapture, no blest mirth!

3.
Yes, on through life's long path,
Still chanting as we go;
From youth to age, by night and day,
In gladness and in woe.

4.
Still lift your standard high,
Still march in firm array;
As warriors through the darkness toil
Till dawns the golden day.

- Edward H. Plumptre
