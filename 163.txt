Sandys - 6.6.8.6.(S.M.)

1.
Help us, O Lord, to learn
the truths your word imparts,
to study that your laws may be
inscribed upon our hearts.

2.
Help us, O Lord, to live
the faith which we proclaim,
that all our thoughts and words and deeds
may glorify your name.

3.
Help us, O Lord, to teach
the beauty of your ways,
that yearning souls may find the Christ
and sing aloud his praise.

- W. W. Reid, junior
