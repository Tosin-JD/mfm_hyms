Aurelia -7.6.7.6.D.

1.
I need Thee, precious Jesus,
For I am full of sin;
My soul is dark and guilty,
My heart is dead within:
I need the cleansing fountain
Where I can always flee,
The blood of Christ most precious,
The sinner’s perfect plea.

2.
I need Thee, blessed Jesus,
For I am very poor;
A stranger and a pilgrim,
I have no earthly store:
I need the love of Jesus
To cheer me on my way.
To guide my doubting footsteps,
To be my strength and stay.

3.
I need Thee, blessed Jesus,
I need a friend like Thee,
A friend to soothe and pity,
A friend to care for me:
I need the heart of Jesus
To feel each anxious care,
To tell my ev’ry trial,
And all my sorrows share.

- Frederick Whitfield
