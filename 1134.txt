Countless Mercies
1 Are you heavy laden and with sorrow tried?
Stop and look to Jesus Helper, Friend, and Guide;
Think of all His mercies such a boundless store!
Tears will change to praises as you count them o’er.

CHORUS
Countless mercies! such a boundless store!
Countless mercies! Press’d and running o’er!
Countless mercies! try to count them o'er,
Till you gaze in wonder at your boundless store.

2.
Think of hidden dangers He hath brought you thro’;
Think of all the burdens He hath borne tor you:
Count His words of comfort in your deepest need;
Count the times when Jesus proved a Friend indeed.

3.
Does your pathway darken ‘neath a cloud of fear?
Count your many mercies, dry each bitter tear;
Even ‘mid the shadows trust Him without fear;
“Home will be the sweeter for the dark down here."

4.
As He looks from heaven now on you and me.
Don’t you know He chooseth what each day shall be?
Trust Him loving wisdom, tho’ the host tears start:
Give to Him the incense of a grateful heart.
