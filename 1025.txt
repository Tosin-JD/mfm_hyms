I have a Shepherd

1.
I have a Shepherd, One I love so well;
How He has bless’d me tongue can never tell;
On the Cross He suffered, shed His blood and died,
That I might ever in His love confide.

CHORUS
Following Jesus, ever day by day.
Nothing can harm me when He leads the way;
Darkness or sunshine, what e’er befall,
Jesus, the Shepherd, is my All in All.

2.
Pastures abundant doth His hand provide,
Still waters flowing ever at my side,
Goodness and mercy follow on my track,
With such a Shepherd nothing can I lack.

3.
When I would wander from the path nastray.
Then He will draw me back into the way;
In the darkest valley I need fear no ill.
For He, my Shepherd, will be with
me still.

4.
When labour's ended and the journey done,
Then He will lead me safely to my home;
There I shall dwell in rapture sure and sweet,
With all the loved ones gathered
round His feet.
