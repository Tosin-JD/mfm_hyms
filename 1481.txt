1481
Give Him the Glory

1.
It was down at the feet of Jesus,
O the happy, happy day!
That my soul found peace in believing,
And my sins were wash’d away.

CHORUS
Let me tell the old, old, story
Of His grace so full and free,
For I feel like giving Him the glory
For His wondrous love to me.

2.
It was down at the feet of Jesus,
Where I found such perfect rest,
Where the light first dawn’d on my spirit,
And my soul was truly blest.

3.
It was down at the feet of Jesus,
Where I bro’t my guilt and sin,
That He cancell’d all my transgressions,
And salvation enter’d in.
