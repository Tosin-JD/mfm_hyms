1.
Praise to the Lord, 
the Almighty, the King of creation;
O my soul, praise him, for he is thy
health and salvation:
All ye who hear,
Now to his temple draw near,
Joining in glad adoration.

2.
Praise to the Lord, 
who o’er all things so wondrously reigneth,
Shieldeth thee gently from harm,
or when fainting sustaineth:
Has thou not seen
How thy heart’s 'wishes have been
Granted in what he ordaineth?

3.
Praise to the Lord, who doth prosper
thy work and defend thee;
Surely his goodness and mercy shall daily attend thee:
Ponder anew
What the Almighty can do,
If to the end he befriend thee.

4.
Praise to the Lord! 
O let all that is in me adore him!
All that hath life and breath, come
now with praises before him!Let the Amen
Sound from his people again:
Gladly for ay we adore him.
