Just a little talk with Jesus

1.
I once was lost in sin but Jesus took me in,
And then a little light from heaven filled my soul;
It bathed my heart in love and wrote my name above,
And just a little talk with Jesus made me whole.

CHORUS
Have a little talk with Jesus,
Tell Him all about our troubles,
Hear our faintest cry, answer by an by; A
Feel a little pray'r wheel turning,
know a little fire is burning.
Find a little talk with Jesus makes it right.

2.
Sometimes my path seems drear,without a ray of cheer.
And then a cloud of doubt may hide the light of day;
The mists of sin may rise and hide the starry skies.
But just a little talk with Jesus clears the way.

3.
I may have doubts and fears, my eyes be filled with tears,
But Jesus is a friend who watches day and night;
I go to Him in pray'r, He knows my evâ€™ry care,
And just a little talk with Jesus makes it right.
