1.
Give Me thy heart,” says the Father above,
No gift so precious to Him as our love;
Softly He whispers, wherever thou art,
"Gratefully trust Me, and give Me thy heart.”

CHORUS
Give Me thy heart, give Me thy heart,”
Hear the soft whisper, wherever thou art:
From this dark world He would draw thee apart;
Speaking so tenderly, “Give Me thy heart.”

2.
“Give Me thy heart,” says the Saviour of men,
Calling in mercy again and again;
“Turn now from sin, and from evil depart,
Have I not died for thee? Give Methy heart.”

3.
“Give Me thy heart, “says the Spirit divine,
"All that thou hast, to My keeping resign;
Grace more abounding is Mine to impart,
Make full surrender and give Me thy heart.”
