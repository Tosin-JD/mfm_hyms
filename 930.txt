Colchester - 8.8.8.8.8.8.

1.
Captain of Isreal's host, and guide
Of all who seek the land above,
Beneath Thy shadow we abide,
The cloud of Thy protecting love;
Our strength, Thy grace; our rule,
Thy word;
Our end, the glory of the Lord.

2.
By Thine unerring Spirit led,
We shall not in the desert stray;
We shall not full direction need,
Nor miss our providential way;
As far from danger as from fear,
While love, almighty love, is near.

3.
We’ve no abiding city here,
But seek a city out of sight;
Thither our steady course we steer,
Aspiring to the plains of light
Jerusalem, the saints’ abode,
Whose founder is the living God.

4.
Through Thee, who all our sins hast borne,
Freely and graciously forgiven,
With songs to Zion we return,
Contending for our native heaven;
That palace of our glorious King,
We find it nearer while we sing.

5.
Raised by the breath of love divine,
We urge our way with strength renewed;
The Church of the first-born to join,
We travel to the mount of God;
With-joy upon our heads arise,
And meet our Captain in the skies.

- Charles Wesley
