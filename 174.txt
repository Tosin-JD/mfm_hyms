West Burn - C. M.

1.
The Spirit breathes upon the word.
And brings the truth to sight;
Precepts and promises afford
A sanctifying light.

2.
A glory gilds the sacred page,
Majestic like the sun:
It gives a light to every age,
It gives, but borrows none.

3.
The hand that gave it still supplies
The gracious light and heat:
His truths upon the nations rise,
They rise but never set.

4.
Lord, everlasting thanks be Thine
For such a bright display,
As makes a world of darkness
shine
With beams of heavenly day.

5.
My soul rejoices to pursue
The steps of Him I love,
Till glory breaks upon my view
In brighter worlds above.

- William Cowper
