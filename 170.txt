Prims - L.M.

1.
My Lord, who in the desert fed
On soul-sustaining heavenly
bread,
Words that were meat and drink
to Thee
0 let them daily nourish me!

2.
And since the sword that
served Thee well
In battling with the powers of
hell
Is even now at hand for me,
Help me to wield it manfully.

3.
But first, O holy, gracious Lord,
0 pray Thee, let Thy Spiritâ€™s sword
Pierce heart and conscience, till I see
Both what I am and ought to be.

4.
Thy word my rule and my delight,
My strength for service and for fight!
For this exhaustless treasure store,
My Lord, I praise Thee and adore!
