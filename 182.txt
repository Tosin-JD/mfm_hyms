Thou Bible everlasting book! - C. M.

1.
Thou Bible everlasting book!
Who knows thy deep secrets?
Your beginning on earth who
knows?
And who can know thy end?

2.
The secrets of the God of
heaven;
Ambassador from heaven;
The sword that killed the sting of death,
God’s own image divine.

3.
A book indeed among thousands
A book of ancient days;
Thou made salvation way so plain
To all mankind on earth.

4.
The treasure of the Three-in-one
The blessed Trinity
Do, interpret Thyself to me
And all my doubts dispel.

5.
Thy pages I’ll open with prayer.
To learn Thy doctrines Lord;
The everlasting Book divine
Show me the Saviour’s love.
