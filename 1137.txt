He Never Forgets His Own

1.
When shadows darken my earthly way,
And long and dreary seems the day.
This promise sweet comes my soul to greet,
He never forgets his own.

CHORUS
He never forgets his own.
He never forgets his own;
Tho’ friends deny, there is
One so nigh Who never forgets his own.

2.
When cherish’d plans all here seem to fail,
And doubt and fear my soul assail,
'Tis then I rest on his loving breast
Who never forgets his own.

3.
O no, he never forgets his own.
And dearer he has daily grown,
Since that glad day when he came to stay,
And made my poor heart his home.
