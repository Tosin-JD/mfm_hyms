Lloyd - C. M.

1.
I worship Thee, sweet Will of God!
And all Thy ways adore;
And every day I live, I long
To love Thee more and more.

2.
I have no cares, O blessed Will!
For all my cares are Thine;
I live in triumph, Lord! for Thou
Hast made Thy triumphs mine.

1.
Ride on, ride on triumphantly,
Thou glorious Will, ride on!
Faithâ€™s pilgrim sons behind Thee take
The road that Thou hast gone.

2.
He always wins who sides with Goo,
To him no chance is lost;
God's Will is sweetest to him when
It triumphs at his cost.

3.
Ill that He blesses is our good;
And unblest good is ill;
And all is right that seems most wrong,
If it be His sweet Will!

- F. W. Faber
