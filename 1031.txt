1031

I CAN HEAR MY SAVIOUR CALLING


1.
I can hear my Saviour calling,
I can hear my Saviour calling,
I can hear my Saviour calling,
‘Take thy cross and follow, follow Me.”

CHORUS
Where He leads me I will follow,
Where He leads me I will follow,
Where He leads me I will follow,
I'll go with Him, with Him all the way

2.
I’ll go with Him thru the judgement,
I’ll go with Him thru the judgement,
I’ll go with Him thru the judgement.
I’ll go with Him, with Him all the way.

3.
He will give me grace and glory,
He will give me grace and glory,
He will give me grace and glory,
And go with me, with me all the way.

- E.W. Blandy
