1.
Lead on, O King Eternal,
The day of march has come;
Hence-forth in fields of conquest
Your tents shall be our home.
Through days of preparation
Your grace has made us strong,
And now, O King Eternal,
We lift our battle song.

2.
Lead on, O King Eternal,
Till sin's fierce war shall cease,
And holiness shall whisper
The sweet Amen of peace;
For not with swords loud clashing.
Nor roil of stiring drums,
With deeds of love and mercy
The heavâ€™nly kingdom comes.

3.
Lead on. O King Eternal,
We follow, not with fears;
For gladness breaks like morning
Where'er Your face appears ;
Your cross is lifted o'er us.
We journey in its light:
The crown awaits the conquest;
Lead on, O God of might.
