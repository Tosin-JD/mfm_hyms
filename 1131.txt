Southwell -8.6.8.6.

1.
He lives in us, the Christ of God,
his Spirit joins with ours;
he brings to us Father’s grace
with power beyond our powers.
And if enticing sin grows strong,
when human nature fails,
God's Spirit in our inner self
fights with us, and prevails.

2.
Our pangs of guilt and fears of death
are Satan’s strategems
by Jesus Christ who died for us
God pardons, who condemns?
And when we cannot feel our faith,
nor bring ourselves to pray,
the Spirit pleads with God for us
in words we could not say.

3.
God gave his Son to save us all
no other love like this!
then shall he ever turn away
from those he marks as his?
And God has raised him from the grave,
in this we stand assured;
so none can tear us from his love
in Jesus Christ our Lord.
