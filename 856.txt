Ring Out The Message

1.
There’s a message true and glad
For the sinful and the sad,
Ring it out, ring it out,
It will give them courage new,
It will, help them to be true;
Ring it out, ring it out

CHORUS
Merrily ring. Speed it away,
Message divine, sent if today;
Let it cheer the lost and those in doubt,
darkness and doubt;
Merrily ring, wonderful news,
Making men free, happy and free,
Ring, ring, ring, ring,
Ring the message out.

2.
Tell the world of saving grace,
Make it known in ev’ry place,
Ring it out, ring it out;
It will give them courage new,
Him from whom all blessing flow;
Ring it out. ring it out.

3.
Sin and doubt to sweep away,
Till shall dawn the better day,
Ring it out, ring it out;
Till the sinful world be won
For Jehovah’s mighty Son;
Ring i out, ring it out.
