Blessed be the name - L.M. with Refrain

1.
All praise to Him who reigns above 
In majesty supreme,
Who gave His Son for man to die,
That He might man redeem!

CHORUS
Blessed be the name, blessed be the name,
Blessed be the name of the Lord;
Blessed be the name, blessed be the name,
Blessed be the name of the Lord.

2.
The name above all names shall Stand,
Exalted more and more,
At God the Father’s own right hand,
Where angel hosts adore.

3.
His name shall be the Counsellor,
The mighty Prince of Peace,
Of all earth’s kingdoms Conqueror,
Whose reign shall never cease.

- William H. Clark
