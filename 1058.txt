Touched By the Master’s Love

1.
I've been touched by the love of the Master today.
I’ve been touched in a most unusual way.
There’s a joy in this heart that was filled with dismay.
Since I’ve been touched by the Master’s love.

CHORUS
Yes,’ I've been touched by a love that is greater.
I know Than all the love that a world full of heartache could show.
And I sing with delight as through this world I go,
Since I’ve been touched by the Master’s love.

2.
I’ve been touched by the love of the Master today,
And it shows in the words I think
and I say.There’s a longing with in that His will I obey,
Since I’ve been touched by the Master's love.
