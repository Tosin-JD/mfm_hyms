Stand, Soldier Of The Cross -S.M.

1.
 Edward Henry Bickersteth

2.
Arise, and be baptized
And wash thy sins away;
Thy league with God be solemnized,
Thy faith avouched today.

3.
Our heavenly country now,
Our Lord and master, thine,
Receive imprinted on thy brow
His passion’s awful sin.

4.
No more thine own but Christ’s
With all the saint of old,
Apostles, seers, evangelists,
And martyr throngs enrolled.

5.
In God’s whole armour strong,
From hell’s embattled pow'rs:
The warfare may be sharp and long
The victory must be ours.

6.
Oh, bright the conqueror’s crown,
The song of triumph sweet,
When faith casts every trophy down
At our great Captain’s feet
