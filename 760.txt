Every day And Hour - 7.9.7.9. and Refrain

1.
Saviour, more, than life Jo me,
I am clinging, clinging close to Thee;
Let Thy precious blood applied,
Keep me ever, ever near Thy side.

CHORUS
Ev'ry day, ev'ry hour,
Let me feel Thy cleansing pow’r;
May Thy tender love to me
Bind me closer, closer, Lord, to Thee.

2.
Thro’ this changing world below,
Lead me gently, gently as I go;
Trusting Thee, I cannot stray,
I can never, never lose my way.

3.
Let me love Thee more and more,
Till this fleeting, fleeting life is o’er;
Till my soul is lost in love,
In a brighter, brighter world above.

- Fanny J. Crosby
