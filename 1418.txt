1418
Heaven Will Surely Be Worth It All

1.
Often I’m hindered on my way.
Burdened so heavy I almost fall;
Then I hear Jesus sweetly say;
“Heaven will surely be worth it all.”

CHORUS
Heaven will surely be worth it all,
Worth all the sorrows that here befall;
After this life with all its strife.
Heaven will surely be worth it all.

2.
Many the trials, toils, and tears,
Many a heartache may here appall;
But the dear Lord so truly says:
“Heaven will surely be worth it all."

3.
Toiling and pain I will endure,
Till I shall hear the death angel call;
Jesus has promised and I’m sure
“Heaven will surely be worth it all.”
