I Just Keep Trusting My Lord

1.
I just keep trusting my Lord as I walk along,
I just keep trusting my Lord, and He gives a song;
Tho' the storm clouds darken the sky O'er the heav’nly trail.
I just keep trusting my Lord He will never fail!
He’s a faithful Friend, such a faithful Friend.
I can count on Him to the very end;
Tho' the storm clouds darken thesky O'er the heav’nly trail.
I just keep trusting my Lord He will never fail!

2.
I just keep trusting my Lord on the narrow way,
I just keep trusting my Lord, as He leads each day;
Tho' the road is weary at times and I’m sad and blue.
I just keep trusting my Lord He will see me through!
He’s a faith Guide, such a faithful Guide,
He is always there walking by my side;
Tho the road is weary at times andI’m sad and blue,
I just keep trusting my Lord He will see me through!
