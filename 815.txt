Where Jesus Is, ‘tis heaven there - L.M. with Refrain

1.
Since Christ my soul from sin set free,
This world has been a heav'n to me;
And ‘mid earth's sorrows and its woe,
Tis heav’n my Jesus here to know.

CHORUS
0 hallelujah, yes, ‘tis heav’n,
Tis heav'n to know my sins forgiv’n;
On land or sea, what matters where,
Where Jesus is, 'tis heaven there

2.
Once heaven seemed afar off place,
Till Jesus showed His smiling face;
Now its begun within my soul,
Twill last while endless ages roll.

3.
What matters where on earth we dwell?
On mountain top, or in the dell?
In cottage, or in mansion fair,
Where Jesus is, ‘tis heaven there.
