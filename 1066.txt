The Lord Has Cleansed Me

1.
The Lord has cleansed and washed me free,
even from sins unknown to me.
Great joy and gladness fill my soul,
for soon I’ll reach the heav’nly goal.
There to behold glorious King,
and songs of praise I’ll ever sing.

2.
A love, this world cannot perceive,
from Christ my Lord I did receive.
His spirit filled my thirsting soul,
and brought me nearer to my goal,
With overwhelming joy I sing,
a hymn to my eternal King.
