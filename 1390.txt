Ye Servants Of The Lord - S.M.

1.
Ye servants of the Lord
Hear ye the Masters call’;
Follow where ever He leads you
He calls you to His way.

2.
The Father you worship
Has the power to bestow;
With complete trust in His promise
Fight manfully like men.

3.
Go, manifest the Lord
Also His great mercy
Among the miserable sinners
Of Adam's fallen race.

4.
In the name of our Lord
We will wish you "God speed”
We pray Him who has sent you out
To prosper all your work
