273
He Brought Me Out

1.
My heart was distressed 'neath Jehovah’s dread frown.
And low in the pit where my sins dragged me down;
I cried to the Lord from the deep miry clay,
Who tenderly brought me out to golden day.

CHORUS
He bro't me out of the miry clay,
He set my feet on the Rock to stay;
He puts a song in my soul today,
A song of praise, hallelujah!

2.
He placed me upon the strong Rock by His side,
My steps were established and here I'll abide;
No danger of falling while here I remain,
But stand by His grace until the crown I gain.

3.
He gave me a song, 'twas a new song of praise;
By day and by night its sweet notes I will raise;
My heart's over flowing, I'm happy and free,
I’ll praise my Redeemer, who has rescued me.

4.
I’ll sing of His wonderful mercy to me,
I’ll praise Him till all men His goodness shall see;
I’ll sing of salvation at home and abroad,
Till many shall hear the truth and trust in God.

5. I’ll tell of the pit, with its gloom and despair.
I’ll praise the dear Father, who answered my prayer;
I’ll sing my new song, the glad story of love,
Then join in the chorus with the saints above.

- Henry J. Zelley, Chorus by H. L. G.
