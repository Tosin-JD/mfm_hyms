Since The Fullness Of His Love Came In

1.
Once my way was dark and dreary.
For my heart was full of sin;
But the sky is bright and cheery,
Since the fullness of His love came in.

CHORUS
I can never tell how much I love Him;
I can never tell His love for me.
For it passeth human measure,
Like a deep, unfathomed sea.
Tis redeeming love in Christ, my Saviour;
In my soul the heav'nly joys begin;
And I live for Jesus only,
Since the fullness of His love came in.

2.
There is grace for all the lowly,
Grace to keep the trusting soul;
Powâ€™r to cleanse and make me holy.
Jesus shall my yielded life control.

3.
Let me spread abroad the story,
Other souls to Jesus win;
For the Cross is now my glory,
Since the fullness of His love came in.
