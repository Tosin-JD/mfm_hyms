Wetherby - C. M.

1.
Ye humble souls that seek the Lord,
Chase all your fears away
And bow with rapture down to see
The place where Jesus lay

2.
Thus low the Lord of Life was brought,
Such wonders love can do;
Thus cold in death that bosom lay,
Which throbbed and bled for you.

3.
But raise your eyes and tune your songs;
The Saviour lives again:
Not all the bolts and bars of death
The Conqueror could detain.

4.
High oâ€™er the angelic bands He rears
His once dishonoured head;
And through unnumbered years He
reigns,
Who dwelt among the dead.

5.
With joy like His shall every saint
His vacant tomb survey;
Then rise with his ascending Lord
To realms of endless day.
