Men of Harlech

1.
Soldier, rouse thee! War is raging,
God and fiends are battle waging;
Ev’ry ransomed power engaging,
Break the Tempter's spell.
Dare ye still lie fondly dreaming,
Wrapt in ease and worldly scheming,
While the multitudes are streaming
Downwards in Hell?

CHORUS
Thro’ the world resounding,
Let the Gospel sounding,
Summon all, at Jesus’ call,
His glorious Cross surrounding.
Sons of God, earth’s trifles leaving,
Be not faithless but believing;
To your conquering Captain cleaving,
Forward to the Fight!

2.
Lord, we come, and from Thee never
Self nor earth our hearts shall sever;
Thine entirely, Thine for ever,
We will fight and die.
To a world of rebels dying,
Heaven and Hell and God defying,
Everywhere we’ll still be crying,
'Will ye perish why?-

3.
Hark! I hear the warriors shouting!
Now the hosts of Hell we’re routing
Courage! onward! never doubting,
We shall win the day.
See the foe before us falling,
Sinners on the Saviour calling,
Throwing off the bondage galling,
Join our glad array.

- George S. Railton
