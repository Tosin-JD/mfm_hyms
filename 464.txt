Chorale -8.7.8.7.D.

1.
Great high Priest, we see Thee stooping,
With our names upon Thy breast;
In the garden groaning, drooping,
To the ground with horrors prest:
Wondering angels stood confounded,
To behold their Maker thus;
And can we remain unwounded,
When we know 'twas all for us?

2.
Nothing but Thy blood, O Jesus,
Can our wayward souls convert;
Nothing else from guilt release us.
Nothing else can melt the heart:
Law and terrors do but harden,
All the while they work alone:
But the sense of blood bought pardon
Can dissolve a heart of stone.


3.
Jesus, all our consolations
Flow from Thee, the sovereign good;
Love, and faith, and hope, and patience
All are purchased by Thy blood:
From Thy fullness we receive them;
We have nothing of our own:
Freely Thou delight'st to give them
To the needy who have none
