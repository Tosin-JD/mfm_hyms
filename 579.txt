Hyfrydol - 8.7.8.7.D.

1.
Come, Thou long expected Jesus,
Born to set Thy people free;
From our fears and sins release us;
Let us find our rest in Thee.

2.
Israel's strength and consolation,
Hope of all the earth Thou art;
Dear Desire of evâ€™ry nation?
Joy of ev'ry longing heart.

3.
Born Thy people to deliver,
Born a Child, and yet a King,
Born to reign in us forever,
Now Thy gracious kingdom bring.

4.
By Thine own eternal Spirit
Rule in all our hearts alone;
By Thine all sufficient merit,
Raise us to Thy glorious throne.

- Charles Wesley
