You Must Open the Door

1.
There’s a Saviour who stands at the door of your heart,
He is longing to enter, why let Him depart?
He has patiently called you so often before,
But you must open the door.

CHORUS
You must open the door,
You must open the door,
When Jesus comes in,He will save you from sin.
But you must open the door.

2.
He has come from the Father salvation to bring,
And His name is called Jesus,
Redeemer and King;
To save you and keep you He pleads evermore,
But you must open the door.

3.
He is loving and kind, full of infinte grace,
In your heart, in your life, will you give Him a place?
He is waiting to bless you, your soul to restore,
But you must open the door.

4.
He will lead you at last to that blessed abode.
To the city of God, at the end of the road,
Where the night never fails, when life's journey is o’er,
But you must open the door.
