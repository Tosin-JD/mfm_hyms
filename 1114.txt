Lord, Shall Thy Children Come To Thee-8.8.8.8.8.8.

1.
Lord, shall Thy children come to Thee!
A boon of love divine we seek:
Brought to Thine arms in infancy,
Ere heart could feel, or tongue could speak,
Thy children pray for grace, that they
May come themselves to Thee to- day.

2.
Lord, shall we come? and come again,
Oft as we see your table spread,
And, tokens of thy dying pain,
The wine pour’d out, the broken bread?
Bless, bless, O Lord, Thy children’s prayer,
That they may come and find Thee there.

3.
Lord, shall we come? not thus alone
At holy time, or solemn rite,
But every hour till life be flown,
Through weal or woe, in gloom or light,
Come to Thy throne of grace, that we
In faith, hope, love, confirm’d may be.

4.
Lord, shall we come? come yet again?
Thy children ask one blessing more;
To come, not now alone; - but then
When life, and death, and time are o’er,
Then, then to come, O Lord,and be
Confirm’d in heaven, confirm’d by Thee.
