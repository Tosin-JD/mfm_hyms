St. Matthew - D.C.M.

1.
We love Thee, Lord; yet not alone,
because Thy bounteous hand
Showers down its rich and
ceaseless gifts on ocean and on land;
We praise Thee, gracious Lord, for
these, yet not for these alone
The incense of Thy children's love
arises to Thy throne.

2.
We love Thee, Lord, because when
we had err'd and gone astray,
Thou didst recall our wandering
souls into the heavenward way,
When helpless, hopeless, we were
lost in sin and sorrow's night,
A guiding ray was gran'ed us from
Thy pure fount of light.

3.
Because, O Lord, Thou lovedst us
with everlasting love,
And sentest forth Thy Son to die
that we might live above;
Because, when we were heirs of wrath.
Thou gavest hopes of heaven;
We love because we much have
sinn'd, and much have been forgiven.
