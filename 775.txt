1.
O help us, Lord; each hour of need
Thy heavenly succour give;
Help us in thought, and word, and deed,
Each hour on earth we live.

2.
O help us when our spirits bleed
With contrite anguish sore;
And, when our hearts are cold and dead,
O help us, Lord, the more.

3.
O help us, through the prayer of faith,
More firmly to believe;
For still the more the servant hath,
The more shall he receive.

4.
If, strangers to Thy fold, we call.
Imploring at Thy feet
The crumbs that from Thy table fall,
â€˜Tis all we dare entreat.

5.
But be it, Lord of mercy, all,
So Thou wilt grant but this;
The crumbs that from Thy table fall
Are light and life and bliss.

6.
O help us, Saviour, from on high;
We know no help but Thee:
O help us so to live and die
As Thine in heaven to be.

- Scottish Psalter
