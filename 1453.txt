1453
When We See Christ

1.
Oft times the day seems long, our trials hard to bear,
We’re tempted to complain, to murmur and despair;
But Christ will soon appear to catch His Bride away,
All tears forever over in God’s eternal day.

CHORUS
It will be worth it all When we see Jesus,
Life’s trials will seem so small whenwe see Christ;
One glimpse of His dear face all sorrow will erase,
So bravely run the race till we see Christ.

2.
Sometimes the sky looks dark with not a ray of light,
We're tossed and driven on, no human help in sight;
But there is One in heav’n whoknows our deepest care,
Let Jesus solve your problem just go to Him in pray’r.

3.
Life’s day will soon be o’er all storms forever past,
We'll cross the great divide to glory, safe at last;
We’ll share the joys of heav’n a harp, a home, a crown,
The tempter will be banished, we’ll lay our burden down.
