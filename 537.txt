St. Michael - S. M.

1.
Come, Holy Spirit, come;
Let Thy bright beams arise;
Dispel the sorrow from our minds.
The darkness from our eyes.

2.
Cheer our desponding hearts,
Thou heavenly Paraclete;
Give us to lie with humble hope
At our Redeemer’s feet.

3.
Revive our drooping faith.
Our doubts and fears remove;
And kindle in our breasts the flame
Of never-dying love.

4.
Convince us all of sin,
Then lead to Jesus’ blood:
And to our wondering view reveal
The secret love of God.

5.
‘Tis Thine to cleanse the heart,
To sanctify the soul,
To pour fresh life in every part,
And new create the whole.

6.
Dwell therefore in our hearts,
Our minds from bondage free;
Then we shall know and praise and love
The Father, Son, and Thee.
