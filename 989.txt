Stand like the brave

1.
O soldier, awake! for the strife is at hand;
With helmet and shield, and a sword in thy hand,
To meet the bold Tempter, go, fearlessly go,
And stand like the brave, with thy face to the foe.

CHORUS
Stand like the brave, stand like the brave,
Stand like the brave, with thy face to the foe!

2.
Whatever thy state, of the Tempter beware,
And turn not thy back, for no armour is there;
The legions of darkness if thouwouldst oâ€™erthrow,
Then stand like the brave, with thy face to the foe.

3.
Doubt not, but press on for thy Captain is near
With grace to support, and with comfort to cheer;
His love like a stream in the desert will flow;
Then stand like the brave, with thy face to the foe.

- Fanny Crosby
