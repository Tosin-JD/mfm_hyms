Cum Christo - L.M.

1.
Let me be with Thee where Thou art,
My Saviour, my eternal rest;
Then only will this longing heart
Be fully and for ever blest.

2.
Let me be with Thee where Thou art,
Thy unveil'd glory to behold;
Then only will this wandering heart
Cease to be treacherous, faithless, cold.

3.
Let me be with Thee where Thou art,
Where spotless saints Thy name adore:
Then only will this sinful heart
Be evil and defiled no more.

4.
Let me be with Thee where Thou art,
Where none can die, where none remove
There neither death nor life will part
Me from Thy presence and Thy love.
