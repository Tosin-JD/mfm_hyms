Blessed Assurance

1.
Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine!
O, what a foretaste of glory divine!
Heir of salvation, purchase of God,
Born of His Spirit, washed in His
blood
CHORUS
This is my story, this is my song,
Praising my Saviour all the day
long;
This is my story, this is my song.
Praising my Saviour all the day long.

2.
Perfect submission, perfect delight,
Visions of rapture now burst on my
sight,
Angels descending, bring from
above
Echoes of mercy, whispers of love.

3.
Perfect submission, all is at rest,I in my Saviour am happy and blest;
Watching and waiting, looking
above.
Filled with His goodness, lost in His
love.

- Fanny J. Crosby
