Angel voices - 8.5.8.5.8.4.3.

1.
Angel voices ever singing
Round Thy throne of light
Angel harps for ever ringing,
Rest not day or night;
Thousands only live to bless Thee,
And confess Thee,
Lord of might.

2.
Thou, who art beyond the farthest
Mental eye can scan.
Can it be that Thou regardest
Songs of sinful man?
Can we feel that Thou art near us
And wilt hear us?
Yea, we can.

3.
Yea, we*know Thy love rejoices
O’er each work of Thine;
Thou didst ears and hands and voices
For Thy praise combine;
Craftsman’s art and music’s measure
For Thy pleasure
Didst design.

4.
Here, great God, today we offer
Of Thine own to Thee;
And for Thine acceptance proffer,
All unworthily,
Hearts and minds, and hands, and voices
In our choicest Melody.

5.
Honour, glory, might, and merit,
Thine shall ever be,
Father, Son, and Holy Spirit,
Blessed Trinity:
Of the best that Thou hast given,
Earth and heaven
Render Thee.

- E. G. Monk
