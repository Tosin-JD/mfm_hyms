When Tempted To Wander Away From The Lord -11.8.11.9. with Ref.

1.
When tempted to wander away form the Lord
I think of the Calvary tree;
Where Jesus once suffered my soul to redeem,
And the heart that was broken for me.

CHORUS
For me, a sinner like me like me,
His heart was broken for me,
By faith I can see on Calvary,
The heart that was broken for me.

2.
When friends are unfaithful I know He is true,
No love is so full and so free;
My eyes fill with tears as I think of
my sins,And the heart that was broken for me.

3.
Atonement divine He has made by His blood,
For ever my story shall be
Of Jesus this loving Redeemer of mine,
And the heart that was broken for me.
