Oh, precious words – C. M.

1.
Oh, precious words that Jesus said!
“The soul that comes to Me,
I will in no wise cast him out,
Whoever he may be.”
“Who ever he may be,
Whoever he may be;
I will in no wise cast him out,
Whoever he may be.”

2.
Oh, precious words that Jesus said!
“Behold, I am the Door;
And all that enter in by Me,
Have life for ever more.”
“Have life forever more,
Have life for evermore;
And all that enter in by Me,
Have life for ever more."

3.
Oh, precious words that Jesus said!
“Come, weary souls oppressed,
Come, take My yoke and learn or Me;
And I will give you rest.”
“And I will give you rest,
And I will give you rest:
Come take My yoke and learn of Me;
And I will give you rest

4.
Oh, precious words that Jesus said!
“The word! overcame;
And they who follow where I lead
Shall conquer in My name.”
“Shall conquer in My name,
Shall conquer n My name,
And they who follow where i lead,
Shall conquer n My name
