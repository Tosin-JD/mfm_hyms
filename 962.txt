The Ship of Temperance - 7.6.D

1.
Take courage, temp’rance workers!
You shall not suffer wreck,
While up to God the people's pray'rs
Are ringing from your deck:
Wait cheerily, ye workers,
For daylight and for land,
The breath of God is in your sails,
Your rudder in His hand.

CHORUS
Sail on, O ship of hope!
Sail on for truth and right;
The breath of God is in your sails,
The haven is in sight!

2.
Sail on, sail on! deep freighted
With blessings and with hopes;
The good of old, with shadowy hands,
Are pulling at your ropes:
Behind you, holy martyrs
Uplift the palm and crown;
Before you, unborn ages send
Their benedictions down.

3.
Speed on! your work is holy,
God’s errands never fail!
Sweep on through storm and darkness wild,
The thunder and the hail:
Toil on, the morning cometh,
The port you yet shall win!
And all the bells of God shall ring
The “Ship of Temperance" in!

- John G. Whittier
