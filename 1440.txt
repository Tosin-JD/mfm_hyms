Ev’rybody Will Be Happy Over There

1.
There's a happy land of promise
over in the great beyond,
Where the saved of earth shall soon the glory share;
Where the souls of men shalt enter
and live on forever more,
Ev'rybody will be happy over there.

CHORUS
Ev'rybody will be happy,
Will be happy over there;
We will shout and Sing His praise,
Ev’rybody will be happy over there.

2.
Mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers
win be singing 'round the throne,
In that land where no one ever knows a care;
And the Christians of all ages will
join in the triumph song,
Ev'rybody will be happy over there

3.
We will hear no body praying and
no mourning in that land.
For no burdens there will be for us to bear;
All the people will be singing "Glory,
glory to the Lamb,”
Ev’rybody will be happy over there.

4.
There well meet the One who
saved us and kept us by His grace, -
And who brought us to that land so bright and fair;
We will praise His name forever as we look upon His face,
Ev’rybody will be happy over there.

- E. M. Bartiett
