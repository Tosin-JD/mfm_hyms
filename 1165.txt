Angels’ Song - L. M.

1.
Jesus, my Saviour, Brother Friend,
On whom I cast my every care,
On, whom for all things I depend,
Inspire, and then accept, my prayer.

2.
If I have tasted of Thy grace,
The grace that sure salvation
brings;
If with me now Thy Spirit stays.
And hovering hides me in His
wings:

3.
Still let Him with my weakness stay,
Nor for a moment's space depart,
Evil and danger turn away,
And keep till He renews my heart.

4.
When to the right or left I stray.
His voice behind me may I hear:
Return, and walk in Christ thy way;
Fly back to Christ, for sin is near.

5.
His sacred unction from above
Be still my Comforter and Guide;
Till all the hardness He remove.
And in my loving heart reside.
6 Jesus, I fain would walk in Thee,
From nature’s every path retreat;
Thou art my Way, my Leader be.
And set upon the rock my feet.

7.
Uphold me, Saviour, or I fall,
O reach me out Thy gracious hand!
Only on Thee for help I call,
Only by faith in Thee I stand.

- Charles Wesley
