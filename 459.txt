Look To The Lamb Of God

1.
If you from sin are longing to be free,
Look to the Lamb of God;
He, to redeem you, died on Calvary,
Look to the Lamb of God.

CHORUS
Look to the Lamb of God,
Look to the Lamb of God,
For He alone is able to save you,
Look to the Lamb of God.

2.
When Satan tempts, and doubts and fears assail,
Look to the Lamb of God;
You in His strength shall over all prevail,
Look to the Lamb of God.

3.
Are you aweary, does the way seem long?
Look to the Lamb of God;
His love will cheer and fill your
heart with song,Look to the Lamb of God.

4.
Fear not when shadows on your path way fall,
Look to the Lamb of God;
In joy or sorrow Christ's all in all,
Look to the Lamb of God.

- H. G. Jackson
