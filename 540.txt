Seymour-7.7.7.7.

1.
Holy Spirit, from on high.
Bend o’er us a pitying eye;
Now refresh the drooping heart;
Bid the pow’r of sin depart.

2.
Light up ev’ry dark recess
Of our heart’s ungodliness;
Show us ev’ry devious way
Where our steps have gone astray.

3.
Teach us, with repentant grief.
Humbly to implore relief;
Then the Saviour’s blood reveal,
And our broken spirits heal.

4.
May we daily grow in grace,
And with patience run the race, '
Trained wisdom, led by love,
Till we reach our home above.
