1.
I’ll Be a Sunbeam
1 Jesus wants me for a sunbeam.
To shine for Him each day;
In ev’ry way try to please Him,
At home, at school at play.

CHORUS
A sunbeam, a sunbeam
Jesus wants me for a sunbeam;
A sunbeam, a sunbeam,
I’ll be a sunbeam for Him.

2.
Jesus wants me to be loving,
And kind to ali I see;
Showing how pleasant and happy
His little one can be.

3.
I will ask Jesus to help me
To keep my heart from sin,
Ever reflecting His goodness,
And always shine for Him.

4.
I’ll be a sunbeam for Jesus
I can if I but try;
Serving Him moment by moment,
Then live with Him on high.
