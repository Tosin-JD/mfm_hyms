OUR PILOT


1.
We ,ail along toward the harbour light.
Over the great life sea;
The breakers roar and the waves dash high,
Who will our pilot be?

CHORUS
The Christ will our Pilot be,
wonderful Guide is He;
So weâ€™ll sail, sail, sail!
Christ will our Pilot be.


2.
We sail along in the morning bright
Happy and glad are we,
But still we ask, as the rocks draw near,
Who will our pilot be?


3.
We sail along, there are shoals, they say,
Dangers from which to flee;
We face the storm with a heavy
heart
Who will our pilot be!
