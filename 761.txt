Sweney - L.M. with Refrain

1.
More about Jesus would I know,
More of His grace to others show,
More of His saving fullness see.
More of His love who died for me.

CHORUS
More, more about Jesus,
More, more about Jesus;
More of His saving fullness see,
More of His love who died for me!
0 to be like Thee, Blessed Redeemer,
I want to be like Jesus, my Lord.

2.
More about Jesus let me learn,
More of His holy will discern;
Spirit of God, my teacher be,
Showing the things of Christ to me.

3.
More about Jesus; in His Word,
Holding communion with my Lord,
Hearing His voice in ev’ry line,
Making each faithful saying mine.

4.
More about Jesus on His throne,
Riches in glory all His own,
More of His kingdom’s sure increase,
More of His coming Prince of Peace.
