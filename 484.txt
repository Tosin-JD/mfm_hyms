Vulpius -8.8.8.4.

1.
Good Christian all, rejoice and sing!
Now is the triumph of our king;
to all the world glad news we bring:
Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia!

2.
The Lord of life is risen today;
death’s mighty stone is rolled away;
let all mankind rejoice and say,
‘Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia!’

3.
We praise in songs of victory
that love, that life, which cannot die,
and sing with hearts uplifted high,
‘Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia!’

4.
Your name we bless, O risen Lord,
and sing today with one accord
the life laid down, the life restored:
Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia!
