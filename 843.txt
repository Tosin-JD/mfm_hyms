Love Others As Thyself - S.M.

1.
“Love others as thyself
It is the Lord’s command
He made Himself an example
By the way He loved us.

2.
"Love him who’s thy neighbour”
Whether in peace or war
Tie taught us to love all our foes,
Repay evil with good.

3.
“Love him who’s thy neighbour
The Lord’s voice trumpets still
So, all of us ought to prepare
To love all our neighbours.

4.
“Love him who's thy neighbour:
And those living next door
Those that are in your
neighbourhood
And all your enemies.

5.
To love our neighbours as
Jesus Himself loved us
Jesus loved all His enemies
And blessed and prayed for them.
