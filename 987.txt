All Hail, I’m saved

1.
Soldiers fighting round the Cross,
Fight for your Lord;
Reckon all things else but loss,
Fight for your Lord..

CHORUS
All hail I’m saved
Oh, come and join our conquering band,
All hail I’m saved
We’ll conquer if we die.

2.
Draw your sword, on God rely,
Fight for your Lord;
And your ever foe defy,
Fight for your Lord.

3.
In the name of Christ your Friend,
Fight for your Lord;
With the powers of Hell contend,
Fight for your Lord;

4.
Fight the fight of faith with me,
Fight for your Lord;
Jesus gives the victory,
Fight for your Lord.

5.
Be thou faithful,’hear Him cry;
Fight for your Lord;
In My service fight and die,
Fight for your Lord.

6.
See in Heaven the glorious prize
Fight for your Lord;
Glittering through the starry skies,
Fight for your Lord.

7.
Faithfully your weapons wield,
Fight for your Lord;
Stand your ground, and win the field,
Fight for your Lord.
