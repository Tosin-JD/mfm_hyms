Hatfield Hall-7.6.7.6.D.

1.
I lay my sins on Jesus,
The spotless Lamb of God;
He bears them all, and frees us
From the accursed load.
I bring my guilt to Jesus
To wash my crimson stains
White in His blood most precious,
Till not a spot remains.

2.
I lay my wants on Jesus;
All fulnes dwells in Him:
He heals all my diseases;
He doth my soul redeem.

3.
I lay my griefs on Jesus,
My burdens and my cares;
He from them all releases;
He all my sorrows shares.
I rest my soul on Jesus,
This weary soul of mine;

4.
His right hand me embraces;
I on His breast recline.
I love the name of Jesus,
Emmanuel, Christ the Lord;
Like fragrance on the breezes
His name abroad is pour'd.

5.
I long to be like Jesus,
Meek, loving, lowly, mild:
I long to be like Jesus,
The Father's Holy Child.
I long to be with Jesus,
Amid the heavenly throng,
To sing with saints His praises,
And learn the angels' song.
