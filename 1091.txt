The Peace That Jesus Gives

1.
Like the sunshine after rain,
Like a rest that follows pain;
Like a hope returned again,
Is the peace that Jesus gives.

CHORUS
Oh, the peace that Jesus gives
Never dies, it always lives;
Like the music of a psalm,
Like a glad, eternal calm,
Is the peace that Jesus gives,
Is the peace that Jesus gives.

2.
Like the soft, refreshing dew,
Like a rosy daybreak new,
Like a friendship tender, true,
Is the peace that Jesus gives.

3.
Like a river deep and long,
With its current, ceaseless, strong,
Like the cadence of a song,
Is the peace that Jesus gives.
