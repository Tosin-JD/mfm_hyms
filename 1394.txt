Victory all the time

1.
They who know the Saviour shall in Him be strong,
Mighty in the conflict of the right ‘gainst wrong.
This the blessed promise given in God’s word,
Doing wondrous exploits, they whoknow the Lord.

CHORUS
Victory! Victory! blessed blood bought victory,
Victory! victory! vict’ry all the time,
As Jehovah liveth, Strength divine He giveth,
Unto those who know Him vict’ry all the time.

2.
In the midst of battle be not thou dismayed,
Though the powers of darkness 'gainst thee are arrayed;
God, thy strength, is with thee, causing thee to stand,
Heaven's allied armies wait at thy command.

3.
Brave to bear life’s testing, strong the foe to meet,
Walking like a hero midst the furnace heat.
Doing wondrous exploits with the Spirit’s sword
Winning souls for Jesus, praise, O praise the Lord.

- Mrs. C. H. Morris
