O Lord Our God, Stretch Out Thy Hand-C M.

1.
O Lord our God, stretch out Thy hand
Let us Thy glory see
That all of us may see Thy sign
To melt the heart of stone.

2.
In Thy mercy, forgive our sins,
Deliver us from guilt
That the new year we have started
May come to end with Thee.

3.
Send Thy Holy Ghost from above
That we may love Thee most
That the sinner who has no love
May learn to love others.

4.
And when we come before Thee, Lord
in our eternal home
That many may join with us here
To give our praise to Thee.
