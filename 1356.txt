1356
Have I done My best for Jesus

1.
I wonder, have I giv’n my best to Jesus
Who died upon the cruel tree?
To think of His great sacrifice at Calv'ry,
I know my Lord expects the best from me.


CHORUS
How many are the lost that I have lifted?
How many are the chained I've helped to free?
I wonder, have I done my best for Jesus,
When He has done so much for me?

2.
The hours that I have wasted are so many,
The hours I’ve spent for Christ so few.
Because of all my lack of love for Jesus,
I wonder if His heart is breaking, too?

3.
I wonder have I cared enough for others,
Or have I let them die alone?
I might have helped a wand’rer to
the Savour;The seed of precious Life I might have sown.

4.
No longer will I stay within the valley,
I'll climb to mountain heights above;
The world is dying now for want of someone
To tell them of the Savior’s match less love.

- Ensign Edwin Young
