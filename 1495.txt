God’s Peace Be Unto This House - 7.7.7.7.D.

1.
God's peace be unto this house
And all those dwelling therein
May God’s peace from heav’n above
Dwell on earth with men of peace;
Let the Holy Ghost descend
That the blessing may come down;
Prince of peace, receive Thy crown
And the fullness of Thy grace.

2.
Christ, Thou art my Lord and God
Let me Thy good herald be:
Remember Thy word, we pray
Visit them and visit me;
Let salvation enter in
This house and all that dwell there.
Deliver our hearts from sin
Make us Thy holy abode.

3.
Do not let us grow weary
Till the promise is fulfilled,
Until we shall be Thine own
By our being sanctified;
Grant that our love be renewed
That we find our lost blessing
And may we be the temple of
Father, Son and Holy Ghost.
