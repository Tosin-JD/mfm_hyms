Bring Them In

1.
Hark! ‘tis the Shepherd’s voice I hear,
Out in the desert dark and drear.
Calling the sheep who’ve gone astray,
Far from the Shepherd’s fold away.

CHORUS
Bring them in, Bring them in,
Bring them in from the fields of sin;
Bring them in, Bring them in,
Bring the wand’ring ones to Jesus.

2.
Who'll go and help the Shepherd kind,
Help Him the wand’ring ones to find?
Who'll bring the lost ones to the fold,
Where they’ll be shelter'd from the cold?

3.
Out in the desert hear their cry.
Out on the mountain wild and nigh,
Hark! ‘tis the Master speaks to thee,
“Go, find my sheep where’er they be.”
