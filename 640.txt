St. Ethelwald - 6.6.8.6.S.M.

1.
Have faith in God, my heart,.
trust and be unafraid;
God will fulfil in every part
each promise he has made.

2.
Have faith in God, my mind,
although your light burns low;
Godâ€™s mercy holds a wiser plan
than you can fully know.

3.
Have faith in God, my sou!,
his cross for ever stands;
and neither life nor death car. pluck
his children from his hands.

4.
Lord Jesus, make me whole;
grant me no resting place
until I rest, heart, mind, and soul,
the captive of your grace.
