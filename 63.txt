COME, YE FAITHFUL, RAISE THE ANTHEM


1.
Come, ye faithful, raise the anthem;
Cleave the skies with shouts of praise;
Sing to Him who brought salvation,
Wondrous in His works and ways;
God eternal, Word incarnate,
Whom the heaven of heavens obeys.

2.
Ere He raised the lofty mountains,
Form’d the sea, or spread the sky,
Love eternal, free and boundless,
Moved the Lord of life to die;
Foreordain’d the Prince of princes
For the throne of Calvary.

3.
Now above the sapphire pavement,
High in unapproached light,
Lo, He lives and reigns for ever
Victor after hard-won fight!
Where the song of the redeemed
Rings unceasing day and night.

4.
Yet this earth He still remembers,
Still by Him the flock are fed:
Yea, He gives them food immortal,
Gives Himself, the living bread;
Leads them where the precious fountain
From the smitten Rock is shed.

- Joachim Neander
