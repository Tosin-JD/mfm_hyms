1.
God, we praise you! God, we bless you!
God, we name you sovereign Lord!Mighty King whom angels worship,
Father, by your church adored:all creation show your glory,
heaven and earth draw near your throne,
singing 'Holy, holy, holy,Lord of hosts, and God alone!â€™

2.
True apostles, faithful prophets,saints who set their world ablaze,
martyrs, once unknown, unheeded,join one growing song of praise,
while your church on earth confessesone majestic Trinity:
Father, Son, and Holy Spirit,God, our hope eternally.

3.
Jesus Christ, the king of glory,everlasting Son of God,
humble was your virgin mother,hard the lonely path you trod:
by your cross is sin defeated,hell confronted face to face,
heaven opened to believers,sinners justified by grace.

4.
Christ, at God's right hand victorious,
you will judge the world you made; Lord, in mercy help your servants
for whose freedom you have paid: raise us up from dust to glory,
guard us from all sin today; King enthroned above all praises,
save your people, God, we pray.
