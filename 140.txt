St. Monica - C. M.

1.
Blest day of God, most calm, most bright,
A day of joy and praise;
The labourer’s rest, the saint’s delight,
The first and best of days.

2.
This day the Lord our Saviour rose
Victorious from the dead;
And, as a conqueror, His foes
In glorious triumph led.

3.
This day of days doth saints enrich
And smiles upon them all:
It is their Pentecost, on which
The Holy Ghost doth fall.

4.
As the first fruits an earnest prove
Of all the sheaves behind,
So they who do the Sabbath love
A happy week shall find.

- M. Rock
