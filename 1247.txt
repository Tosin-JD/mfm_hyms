Do You Know What Makes Us Happy

1.
Do you know what makes us happy,
When so many hearts are sad?
We are little friends of Jesus,
That is why we are so glad;

CHORUS
We are little friends, we are loving friends,
We are happy, happy little friends of Jesus;
We are little friends, we are loving friends,
We are happy all day along.

2.
Jesus loves the children clearly.I
n His word He tells them so;
Once He took them up and blessâ€™d them.
Many, many years ago.

3.
We are little lambs of Jesus;
He, our Shepherd kind and dear,
Speaks, and though we do not see Him,
In our hearts His voice we hear.

- S. Martin
