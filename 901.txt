901
I Love Him

1.
Gone from my heart the world and all its charm;
Gone are my sins and all that would alarm;
Gone evermore, and by His grace I know
The precious blood of Jesus cleanses white as snow.

CHORUS
I love Him, I love Him,
Because He first loved me,
And purchased my salvation on Calv'ry's tree.

2.
Once I was lost upon the plains of sin;
Once was a slave to doubts and fears within;
Once was afraid to trust a loving God,
But now my guilt is washed away in Jesus' blood.

3.
Once I was bound, but now I am set free;
Once I was blind, but now the light I see;
Once I was dead, but now in Christ I live.
To tell the world the peace that Healone can give.
