Cleansing fountain - C.M.D.

1.
There is a fountain filled with blood
Drawn from Immanuel’s veins,
And sinners plunged beneath that flood
Loose all their guilty stains:
Lose all their guilty stains,
Lose all their guilty stains;
And sinners plunged beneath that
flood
Lose all their guilty stains.

2.
The dying thief rejoiced to see
That fountain in his day,
And there may I, though vile as he,
Wash all my sins away:
Wash all my sins away,
Wash all my sins away;
And there may I, though vile as he,
Wash all my sins away.

3.
Dear dying Lamb, Thy precious blood
Shall never lose its pow’r,
Till all the ransomed Church of God
Be saved to sin no more:
Be saved to sin no more,
Be saved to sin no more;
Till all the ransomed Church of God
Be saved to sin no more.

4.
E'er since by faith I saw the stream
Thy flowing wounds supply.
Redeeming love has been my
theme
And shall be till I die:
And shall be till I die,
And shall be till I die;
Redeeming love has been my
themeAnd shall be till I die.

5.
I do believe, I will believe,
That Jesus died for me!
That on the cross He shed His blood,
From sin to set me free
From sin to set me free
From sin to set me free
That on the cross He shed His blood,
From sin to set me free.

- William Cowper
