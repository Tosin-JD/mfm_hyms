Enjoying a Full Salvation

1.
If you want pardon, if you want peace,
If you want sorrow or sighing to cease,
Look up to Jesus who died on the tree,
To purchase a full salvation.

CHORUS
Living beneath the shade of the cross,
Counting the jewels of earth but dross;
Cleans’d in the blood that flowsfrom His side.
Enjoying a full salvation.

2.
If you want Jesus to reign in your soul,
Plunge in the fountain and you shall be whole;
Washed in the blood of the Crucified One,
Enjoying a full salvation.

3.
If you want boldness, take part In the fight;
If you want purity, walk in the light;
If you want liberty, shout and be free,
Enjoying a full salvation.

4.
If you want holiness, cling to the cross.
Counting the riches of earth as dross;
Down at His feet you’ll be cleans'd and made free,
Enjoying a full salvation.
