Gird on the Sword and Armour - 7.6.

1.
Gird on the sword and armour!
Go raise the banner high!
The Captain of Salvation
To thee is ever nigh.

CHORUS
Then wave the glorious banner!
Press forward in His name;
Fear not, for soon thy Captain
Will victory proclaim!

2.
Gird on the sword and armour!
Let faith be thy strong shield;
His promise shall sustain then
On every battle field.

3.
Gird on the sword and armour;
Press on, the foe to fight;
No enemy can harm thee.
For God sustains the right.

- C. H. Mann
