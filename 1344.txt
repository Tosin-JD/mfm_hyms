1.
Blow ye the trumpet, blow
The gladly solemn sound;
Let all the nations know,
To earth's remotest bound;
The year of jubilee is come,
The year of jubilee is come,
Return, ye ransom’d sinners, home.

2.
Jesus, our great high priest,
Has full atonement made,
Ye weary spirits rest,
Ye mourning souls be glad;
The year of jubilee is come,
The year of jubilee is come,
Return, ye ransom'd sinners, home

3.
Exalt the Lamb of God,
The sin atoning Lamb,
Redemption by His blood
Through all the world proclaim;
The year of jubilee is come
The year of jubilee is come.
Return ye ransom’d sinners, home.

- Charles Wesley
