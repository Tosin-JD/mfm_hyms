Love Wonderful Love of God

1.
Love, wonderful love of God,
So boundless and so free;
To think that Christ His only Son
Should die on Calvary,
Oh, Love so great, so vast, so high,
That He should for the sinner die.

CHORUS
Love, wonderful love, the love of God to me,
Love, wonderful love, so great, so rich, so free:
Wide, as wide as the ocean, deep, as deep as the sea,
High, as high as the heav’ns above, His love to me.

2.
Love, wonderful love of God,
To me has been made known,
To me the Spirit freely gives.
And claims me for His own,
Oh, love so wondrous, so divine,
That I am His and He is mine.

3.
Love, wonderful love of God,
With joy I now proclaim,
To sinners lost that they may have
Salvation through His name
That they may now with others prove,
“Christ’s dying, and undying love.”
