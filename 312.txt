Save Me at the Cross

1.
Loving Saviour, Hear my cry,
Hear my cry, hear my cry;
Trembling to Thine arms I fly:
O save me at the Cross!
I have sinn’d, but Thou hast died.
Thou hast died, Thou hast died;
In Thy mercy let me hide:
O save me at the Cross!

CHORUS
Lord Jesus, receive me,
No more would I grieve Thee,
Now, blessed Redeemer,
0 save me at the Cross!

2.
Tho’ I perish I will pray,
0 will pray, I will pray;
Thou of life the Living Way;
O save me at the Cross!
Thou hast said Thy grace is free,
Grace is free, grace is free:
Have compassion, Lord, on me:
O save me at the Cross!

3.
Wash me in Thy cleansing blood,
Cleansing blood, cleansing blood;
Plunge me now beneath the flood:
O save me at the Cross!
Only faith will pardon bring,
Pardon bring, pardon bring:
In that faith to Thee I cling:
O save me at the Cross!
