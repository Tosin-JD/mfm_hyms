Adoro Te-10.10.10.10.

1.
Here, O my Lord, I see Thee face to face;
Here would I touch and handle things unseen.
Here grasp with firmer hand the eternal grace.
And all my weariness upon Thee lean.

2.
Here would I feed upon the bread of God,
Here drink with Thee the royal wine of heaven;
Here would I lay aside each earthly load.
Here taste afresh the calm of sin forgiven

3.
I have no help but Thine; nor do I need
Another arm save Thine to leanupon:
It is enough, my Lord, enough indeed;
My strength is in Thy might, Thy might alone.

4.
Mine is the sin, but Thine the righteousness;
Mine is the guilt, but Thine the cleansing blood;
Here is my robe, my refuge, and my peace
Thy blood, Thy righteousness, O Lord my God.

5.
Feast after feast thus comes and passes by,
Yet, passing, points to the glad feast above,
Giving sweet foretaste of the festal joy,
The Lamb’s great bridal feast of bliss and love.

- Horatius Bonar
