Mercy - 7.7.7.7.

1.
Holy Ghost, with light divine.
Shine upon this heart of mine;
Chase the shades of night away,
Turn my darkness into day.

2.
Holy Ghost, with pow’r divine,
Cleanse this guilty heart of mine;
Long hath sin without control
Held dominion o’er my soul.

3.
Holy Ghost, with joy divine,
Cheer this saddened heart of mine;
Bid my many woes depart,
Heal my wounded, bleeding heart.

4.
Holy Spirit, all divine,
D*£ll within this heart of mine;
Cast down ev’ry idol throne,
Reign supreme and reign alone.
