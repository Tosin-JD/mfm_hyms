St. Ambrose - L.M.

1.
And dost Thou say, Ask what Thou wilt?
Lord, I would seize the golden hour;
I pray to be released from guilt,
And freed from sin and Satan's power.

2.
More of Thy presence, Lord, impart.
More of Thine image let Me bear;
Erect Thy throne within my heart,
And reign without a rival there.

3.
Give me to read my pardon seal'd.
And from Thy joy to draw my strength,
To have Thy boundless love reveal'd,
Its height, and depth, its breath and length.

4.
Grant these requests, I ask no more,
But to Thy care the rest resign;
Living or dying, rich or poor,
All shall be well if Thou art mine.

- Isaac Watts
