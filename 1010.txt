OUR FATHER WERE HIGH MINDED MEN

1.
Our fathers were high minded men,
Who firmly kept the faith:
To freedom and to conscience true,
In danger and in death;
Great names had they, but greater souls,
True heroes of their age,
Who, like a rock in stormy seas,
Defied opposing rage.

2.
For all they suffered little cared
Those earnest men and wise;
Their zeal for Christ, their love of truth
Made them the shame despise:
Nor should their deeds be eâ€™er forgot,
For noble men were they
Who struggled hard for sacred rights,
And bravely won the day.

3.
As faithful as our fathers were
May we their children be:
And in our hearts their spirit live.
That gained our liberty.
God help us all to do and dare
Whatever can be done,
Till for the good old cause of truth
The victory shall be won.
