1.
So send I you to labour unrewarded,
To serve unpaid, unloved, unsought, unknown,
To bear rebuke, to suffer scorn and scoffing
So send I you. to toll for Me alone

2.
So send I you to bind the bruised and broken.
O'er wand'ring souls to work, to weep, to wake.
To bear the burdens of a world aweary
So send I you, to suffer for My sake

3.
So send I you to loneliness and longing, 
With heart ahung'ring for the loved
and known,Forsaking home and kindred, friend and dear one
So send I you, to know My love alone

4.
So send I you to leave your life's ambition.
To die to dear desire, self will resign.
To labour long, and love where men revile you
So send I you. to lose your life in Mine,

5.
So send I you to hearts made hardby hatred,
To eyes made blind because they will not see,
To spend, tho it be blood, to spend and spare not
So send I you, to taste of Calvary.

- Margaret Clarkson
