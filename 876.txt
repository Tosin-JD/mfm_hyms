1.
O turn ye! O turn ye! for why will ye die
When God in great mercy is drawing so nigh?
Now Jesus invites you, the Spirit says, Come!
And angels are waiting to welcome you home.

2.
How vain the delusion that, while you delay,
Your hearts may grow better by staying away!
Come wretched, come thirsty, come just as you be,
While streams of salvation are flowing so free.

3.
In riches, in pleasures, what can you obtain
To soothe your affliction or banish your pain,
To bear up your spirits when summonâ€™d to die,
Or take you to Christ in the clouds of the sky?

- Josiah Hopkins
