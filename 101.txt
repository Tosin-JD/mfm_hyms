101

THROUGH THE NIGHT THY ANGELS KEPT

1.
Through the night thy angels kept
Watch beside me while I slept;
Now the dark has passed away,
Thank thee, Lord, for this new day.

2.
North and south and east and west
May thy holy name be blest;
Everywhere beneath the sun,
As in heaven, thy will be done.

3.
Give me food that I may live;
Every naughtiness forgive;
Keep all evil things away
From thy little child this day.
