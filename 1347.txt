Harvest Fields

1.
Harvest fields are waiting,
White the waving grain;
Christ the Master calleth,
Soon the day will wane.
Hasten at His bidding,
Join the reaper band;
Help them at their labour.
Work with willing hand.

CHORUS
Harvest fields are waiting,
Labour while you may;
Time is swiftly flying,
Come and work today.

2.
Harvest fields are waiting,
Do not linger long;
Borne upon the breezes
Comes the reaper's song:
Patiently, O toiler,
Pluck the golden grain
Ere the shades of ev’ning
Fall o’er hill and plain.

3.
Harvest fields are waiting.
Who will come today,
Join the band of reapers,
Bear the sheaves away?
Soon the day of toiling
Will be ever past;
May the Master’s greeting Be,
Well done! at last.
