231
Come Unto Me

1.
O heart bow’d down with sorrow!
O eyes that long for sight!
There’s gladness in believing;
In Jesus there is light.

CHORUS
“Come unto Me, all ye that labour
and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest
Take My yoke upon you, and learn of Me;
for I am meek and lowly in heart:
and ye shall find rest unto your souls.”

2.
Earth’s fleeting gain and pleasure
Can never satisfy:
‘Tis love our joy doth measure,
For love can never die.

3.
Divinest consolation
Doth Christ the Healer give;
Art thou in condemnation?
Believe, repent, and live.

4.
His peace is like a river,
His love is like a song;
His yoke’s a burden never;
Tis easy all day long.

- F. E. Belden
