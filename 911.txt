911
San Gabriel

1.
My new life I owe to Thee,
Jesus, Lamb of Calvary;
Sin was canceled on the tree
Jesus, blessed Jesus!

2.
Humbly at Thy cross I’d stay
Jesus, keep me there, I pray;
Teach me more of Thee each day,
Jesus, blessed Jesus!

3.
Grant me wisdom, grace and pow’r
Lord, I need Thee ev'ry hour;
Let my will be lost in Thine,
Jesus, blessed Jesus!

4.
Saviour, Thou hast heard my plea
Thou art near, so near to me;
Now I feel Thy strengthening pow’r,
Jesus, blessed Jesus!
