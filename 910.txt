Try Jesus, He satisfies

1.
Come unto Jesus all ye that labour,
All that are weary, worn and defiled.
Bring Him your burdens, seek now
His favour,
Tell Him your sorrows, in Him
confide.
CHORUS
He satisfies, He satisfies,
O will you let Him in your heart
abide?
He’ll keep your soul, what ever
betide.
Won’t you try Jesus, He satisfies.

2.
Come unto Jesus, don’t waste a
moment
Your time so precious is fleeting
by,
All your transgress }, freely
confessing.
He in His mercy, safety will hide.

3.
Come unto Jesus, Saviour and
brother,
Surely you need Him truest and
best.
Dearer than father, fonder than
mother.
Come unto Jesus, He’ll give you rest.

- Robert Martin
