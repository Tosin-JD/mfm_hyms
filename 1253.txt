Glory-8.6.8.6.8.8.

1.
Around the throne of God in heav'n
Thousands of children stand.
Children whose sins are all forgiv’n,
A holy, happy band..

CHORUS
Singing; Glory, glory, glory!
Singing: Glory, glory, glory!

2.
What brought them to that world cabove?
That heav’n so bright and fair,
Where all is peace, and joy, and love,
How came those children there?

3.
Because the Saviour shed His blood
To wash away their sin;
loathed in that pure and precious flood,
Behold them white and clean.

4.
On earth they sough! the Saviour’s race,
On earth they loved His name:
So now they see His blessed face,
And stand before the Lamb.
