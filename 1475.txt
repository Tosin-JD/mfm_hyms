Wondrous Story - 8.7.8.7. with Refrain

1.
I will sing the wondrous story
Of the Christ who died for me
How He left His home in glory
For the cross of Calvary.

CHORUS
Yes, I'll sing the wondrous story
Of the Christ who died for me,
Sing it with the saints in glory,
Gathered by the crystal sea.

2.
I was lost but Jesus found me
Found the sheep that went astray,
Threw His loving arms around me,
Drew me back into His way.

3.
Days of darkness still come o’er me,
Sorrow’s paths I often tread;
But the Saviour still is with me
By His hand I’m safely led.

1.
He will keep me till the river
Rolls its waters at my feet;
Then He’ll bear me safely over,
Where the loved ones I shall meet.
