1.
My spirit, soul, and body
Jesus, I give to Thee,
A consecrated off'ring,
Thine evermore to De.
My all is on the altar;
Lord, I am all Thine own;
Oh, may my faith ne'er falter!
Lord, keep me Thine alone.

2.
O Jesus, mighty Saviour!
0 trust in Thy great name,
I look for Thy salvation,
Thy promise now I claim.
Now, Lord, I yield my members,
From sin's dominion free,
For warfare and for triumph,
As weapons unto Thee.

3
Oh, blissful self-surrender,
To live, my Lord, by Thee!
Now, 3on of God. my Saviour,
Live out Thy life in me.
I'm Thine, O blessed Jesus,
Washed in Thy precious blood,
Sealed by Thy Holy Spirit,
A sacrifice to God.
