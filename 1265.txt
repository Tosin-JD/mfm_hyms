Glenfinlas -6.5.6.5.

1.
Do no sinful action;
Speak no angry word;
Ye belong to Jesus,
Children of the Lord.

2.
Christ is kind and gentle,
Christ is pure and true,
And His little children
Must be holy too.

3.
Thereâ€™s a wicked spirit
Watching round you still,
And he tries to tempt you
To all harm and ill.

4.
But ye must not hear him,
Though 'tis hard for you
To resist the evil,
And the good to do.

5.
Christ is your own master;
He is good and true,
And His little children
Must be holy too.
