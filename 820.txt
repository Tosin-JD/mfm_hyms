Wonder of it all - Irregular Meter

1.
There’s the wonder of sunset at evening,
The wonder as sunrise I see;
But the wonder of wonders that thrills my soul
Is the wonder that God loves me.

CHORUS
O, the wonder of it aft? The wonder of It all!
Just to think that God loves me.
O, the wonder of it all! The wonder of it all!
Just to think that God loves me.

2.
There's the wonder of spring time and harvest,
The sky, the stars, the sun;
But the wonder of wonders that thrills my soul
Is a wonder that’s only begun.

- George Beverly S.hea
