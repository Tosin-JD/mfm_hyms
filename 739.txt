I Found the Answer

1.
I was weak and weary, I had gone astray.
Walking in the darkness, I couldn’tfind my way;
Then a light came shining to lead me from despair,
All my sins forgiven, and I was free from care.

CHORUS
I found the answer, I learned to pray!
With faith to guide me, I found the way;
The sun is shining for me each day,
I found the answer, I learned to pray!

2.
I was sad and lonely, all my hopes were gone,
Days were long and dreary, I couldn't carry on;
Then I found the courage to keep my head up high,
Once again I’m happy and here’s the reason why:

3.
Keep your Bible with you, read it ev’ry day,
Always count your blessings and always stop to pray;
Learn to keep believing and faith will see you through,
Seek to know contentment and it will come to you.
