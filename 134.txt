St. Gabriel 8.8.8.4.

1.
The radiant morn hath passâ€™d away,
And spent too soon her golden store;
The shadows of departing day,
Creep on once more.

2.
Our life is but an autumn day,
Its glorious noon how quickly past;
Lead us O Christ, Thou living way,
Safe home at last.

3.
O by Thy soul-inspiring grace
Uplift our hearts to realms on high;
Help us to look to that bright place
Beyond the sky.

4.
where light, and life, and joy, and peace
In undivided empire reign
And thronging angels never cease
their deathless strain;

5.
where saints are cloth'd in spotless white
and ev'ning shadows never fall;
Where Thou, eternal Light of Light,
Art Lord of all.
