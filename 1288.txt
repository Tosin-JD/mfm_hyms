Dublin - C. M.

1.
See Israel's gentle Shepherd stand
With all engaging charms;
Hark! how He calls the tender lambs,
And folds them in His arms.

2.
Permit them to approach, He cries,
Nor scorn their humble name!
For 'twas to bless such souls as these
The Lord of angels came.

3.
We bring them, Lord, in thankful hands,
And yield them up to Thee;
Joyful that we ourselves are Thine,
Thine let our children be.

- Philip Doddridge
