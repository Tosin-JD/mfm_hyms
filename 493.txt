Mead House - 8.7.8.7.D.

1.
Alleluia, Alleluia!
Hearts to heaven and voices raise;
Sing to God a hymn of gladness
Sing to God a hymn of praise;
He who on the cross a victim
For the world’s salvation bled,
Jesus Christ, the King of glory,
Now is risen from the dead.

2.
Now the iron bars are broken,
Christ from death to life is born,
Glorious life, and life immortal,
On this holy Easter morn.
Christ has triumphed, and we conquer
By his mighty enterprise,
We with him to life eternal
By his resurrection rise.

3.
Christ is risen, Christ the first-fruits
Of the holy harvest field,
Which will all its full abundance
At his second coming yield;
Then the golden ears of harvest
Will their heads before him wave,
Ripened by his glorious sunshine,
From the furrows of the grave.

4.
Christ is risen, we are risen;
Shed upon us heavenly grace,
Rain and dew and gleams of glory
From the brightness of thy face;
That, with hearts in heaven dwelling,
We on earth may fruitful be,
And by angel hands be gathered,
And be ever, Lord, with thee.

- Christopher Wordsworth
