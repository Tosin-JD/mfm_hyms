Lord, I Desire A Sinless Heart - C.M.

1. 
Lord, I desire a sinless heart
With which to praise my God
A heart that knows Thy cleansing blood
That was shed free for me.

2.
A heart of patience and meekness
My dear Redeemer’s throne
Where Christ is in perfect control
And absolutely reigns.

3.
A humble heart that flees from sin
Full of faith and is clean
That life nor death can separate
From Christ who dwells within.

4.
A heart that's entirely holy
That’s full of divine love
Perfect, honest, holy and good,
An image, Lord, of Thee.

5.
Lord I desire a life like Thine
Come quickly down I pray,
And write a new name in my heart
Thy name, O love divine.
