Life’s railway to heaven

1.
Life is like a mountain rail road,
With an engineer that’s brave;
We must make the run successful,
From the cradle to the grave;
Watch the curves, the fills, the tunnels;
Never falter, never quail;
Weep your hand upon the throttle,
And your eye upon the rail.

CHORUS
Blessed Saviour, Thou wilt guide us
Till we reach that blissful shore;
When the angels wait to join us
In Thy praise for evermore.

2.
You will roll up grades of trial;
You will cross the bridge of strife;
See that Christ is your conductor
On this lightning train of life;
Always mindful of obstruction,
Do your duty, never fail;
Keep your hand upon the throttle,
And your eye upon the rail.

3.
You will often find obstructions;
Look for storms of wind and rain;
On a fill, or curve, or trestle,
They will almost ditch your train;
Put your trust alone in Jesus;
Never falter, never fail;
Keep your hand upon the throttle,
And your eye upon the rail.

4.
As you roll across the trestle,
Spanning Jordan's swelling tide;
You behold the Union Depot
Into which your train will glide;
There you’ll meet the Superintendant,
God the Father, God the Son,
With the hearty joyous plaudit,
“Weary pilgrim, welcome home.”
