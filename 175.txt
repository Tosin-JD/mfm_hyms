Clonmel - C.M.D.

1.
Thy word is like a garden. Lord,
With flowers bright and fair;
And evâ€™ry one who seeks may pluck
A lovely cluster there.
Thy Word is like a deep, deep mine;
And jewels rich and rare
Are hidden in its mighty depths
For ev'ry searcher there.

2.
Thy Word is like a starry host;
A thousand rays of light
Are seen to guide the traveller
And make his path way bright.
O may I love Thy precious Word,
May I explore the mine.
May I the fragrant flowers glean,
May light upon me shine.

- Edwin Hodder
