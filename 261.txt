Look not behind thee

1.
Look not behind thee; O sinner, beware!
Haste to the mountain, Thy refuge is there;
Trust not the voices That lure thee to stay:
Jesus is calling thee Then why still delay?

CHORUS
List to the warning! no longer remain!
Fly from the valley escape from the plain!
Turn from the voices that lure thee to stay:
Angels are calling thee then why still delay?

2.
Look not behind thee; O lost one, beware!
Why dost thou linger ‘Twixt hope and despair?
Danger and darkness Encompassthy way:
Jesus is calling thee Then why still delay?

3.
Look not behind thee, The tempter is near;
Speed to the mountain, Thy pathway is clear:
Jesus who loves thee Is calling today:
Come to thy Father’s house Oh why still delay?
