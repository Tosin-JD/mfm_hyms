I Need Jesus

1.
I need Jesus, my need I now confess;
No one like Him in times of deep distress;
I need Jesus, the need I gladly own;
Tho’ some may bear their load alone,
Yet I need Jesus.

CHORUS
I need Jesus, I need Jesus,
I need Jesus ev’ry day!
Need Him in the sunshine hour.
Need Him when the storm clouds low’r;
Ev’ry day along my way,
Yes. I need Jesus.

2.
I need Jesus, I need a Friend like him,
A Friend to guide when paths of life are dim;
I need Jesus, when foes my soul assail;
Alone I know I can but fail,
So I need Jesus.

3.
I need Jesus, I need Him to the end;
No one like Him He is the sinners’ Friend:
I need Jesus, no other friend will do;
So constant, kind, so strong, andtrue,
Yes, I need Jesus.

- G. O. Webster
