In The Great Triumphant Morning

1.
In the great triumphant morning,
when we hear the Bridegroom cry,
And the dead in Christ shall rise,
We’ll be changed to life immortal,
In the twinkling of an eye,
And meet Jesus in the skies.

CHORUS
We shall all rise to meet Him,
we shall all go to greet Him,
In the morning when the dead in
Christ shall rise.
We shall all rise to meet Him,
we shall all go to greet Him,
And shall have the marriage supper  in the skies.

2.
In the great triumphant morning,
what a happy time ‘twill be,
When the dead in Christ shall rise,
When the Lord descends in glory,
Sets His waiting children free,
And we meet Him in the skies.

3.
In the great triumphant morning,
when the harvest is complete,
And the dead in Christ shall rise,
We’ll be crowned with life immortal,
Christ and all the loved ones meet,
In the rapture in the skies.

4.
In the great triumphant morning,
all the kingdom we’ll possess,
Then the dead in Christ shall rise,
Reign as kings and priests eternal,
Under Christ for ever blest,
After meeting in the skies.
