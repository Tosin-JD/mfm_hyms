1201
I know He’s mine

1.
There’s One above all earthly friends
Whose love all earthly love transcends
It is my Lord and Christ divine.
My Lord because I know he’s mine.

CHORUS
I know he's mine, this friend so dear,
He lives with me, he’s ever near;
Ten thousand charms around him shine,
And best of all I know he’s mine.

2.
He’s mine because he died for me,
He saved my soul he set me free;
With joy I worship at his shrine And cry,
“Praise God, I know he’s mine ”

3.
He’s mine because he’s in my heart,
And never, never will we part;
Jesus the branch is to the vine I’m
joined to Christ;
I know he’s mine,

4.
Some day upon the streets of gold
Mine eyes his glory shall behold,
Then, while his arms around me twine.
I’ll cry for joy, “I know he’s mine."
