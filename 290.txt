Once My Eyes Were Blind - 12.12.12.13. with Ref

1.
Once my eyes were blind to the beauty of the Lord
Once my ears were closed to the pleading of His word;
Once these hands of mine pressed the thorn-crown on His brow;
But all this He has forgiven, and it’s alright now

CHORUS
Yes, it’s alright now. Yes, it’s alright now
He has heard my prayer and it's alright now;
Yes, it’s alright now, yes, it's alright now
All my sins are covered and it’s alright now.

2.
Once I loved the world with its glitter and its show,
I was captive held with the pleasures here below,
But one day He came, though I cannot tell you how,
With His blood my sins He covered, and it’s alright now.

3.
Oh it is so precious to be alone with Him,
When the shadows fall and my eyes with tears are dim,
Just to feel His hand rest in love upon my brow,
And to hear Him gently whisper, “It is alright now.”
