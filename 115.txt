Come To The Morning Prayer - S.M.

1.
Come to the morning prayer,
Come, let us kneel and pray;
Prayer is the Christian pilgrim’s
staff,
To walk with God all day.

2.
At noon beneath the Rock
Of Ages rest and pray;
Sweet is the shadow from the heat,
When the sun smites by day.

3.
At eve shut to the door,
Round the home-altar pray,
And finding there the house of God,
At heaven’s gate closed the day.

4.
When midnight seals our eyes,
Let each in spirit say,
I sleep, but my heart waketh, Lord,
With Thee to watch and pray.
