Lord, It Is Eventide

1.
Lord, it is eventide: the light of day is waning;
Far o’er the golden land earth’s voices faint and fall;
Lowly we pray to Thee for strength and love sustaining,
Lowly we ask of Thee Thy peace upon us all.
Oh, grant unto our souls.

CHORUS
Light that groweth not pale
Love that never can fail till life shall cease;
Joy no trial shall mar,
Hope that shineth afar,
Faith serene as a star,
And Christ’s own peace.

2.
Lord, it is eventide we turn to Thee for healing
Like those of Galilee who came at close of day;
Speak to our waiting souls their hidden founts unsealing;
Touch us with hands divine that take our sin away.
Oh, grant unto our souls.

3.
Saviour, Thou knowest all, the trial and temptation,
Knowest the wilfulness and waywardness of youth;
Help us to cling to Thee, our
strength and our salvation,
Help us to find in Thee one eternal Truth.
Oh, grant unto our souls.

4.
Lord it is eventide: our hearts await thy giving,
Wait for that peace divine that none can take away,
Peace that shall lift our souls to loftier heights of living,
Till we abide with Thee in everlasting day
Oh, grant unto our souls.
