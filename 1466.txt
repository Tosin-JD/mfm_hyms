Asleep in Jesus! Blessed sleep - L.M

1.
Asleep in Jesus! Blessed sleep!
From which none ever wake to weep;
A calm and undisturbed repose,
Unbroken by the last of foes.

2.
Asleep in Jesus! Oh, how sweet
To be for such a slumber meet!
With holy confidence to sing
That death hath lost its venomed sting

3.
Asleep in Jesus! Peaceful rest!
Whose waking is supremely blest;
No fear - no woe - shall dim the hour
That manifests the Saviour's power.

4.
Asleep in Jesus! O for me
May such a blissful refuge be!
Securely shall my ashes lie,
waiting the summons from on high.

- Margaret Mackay (1832)
