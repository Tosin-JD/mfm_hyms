Saffron Walden - 8.8.8.6.

1.
O God of Love, to Thee we bow,
And pray for these before Thee now,
That, closely knit in holy vow.
They may in Thee be one.

2.
When days are filled with pure delight.
When paths are plain and skies are bright,
Walking by faith and not by sight,
May they in Thee be one.

3.
When stormy winds fulfil Thy will,
And all their good seems turned toill.
Then, trusting Thee completely, still
May they in Thee be one.

4.
0 Whate'er in life shall be their share
Of quickening joy or burdening care,
In power to do and grace to bear,
May they in Thee be one.

5.
Eternal Love, with them abide;
In Thee for ever may they hide,
For even death cannot divide
Those whom Thou makest one.

- William Vaughan Jenkins
