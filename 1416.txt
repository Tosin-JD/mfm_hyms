No Tears In Heaven

1.
No tears in Heaven, no sorrows given,
All will be glory in that land;
There’ll be no sadness, all will be gladness,
When we shall join that happy band.

CHORUS
No tears no tears, no tears up there,
Sorrow and pain will all have flown;
No tears no tears, no tears up there,
No tears in Heaven will be known.

2.
Glory is waiting, waiting up yonder,
Where we shall spend an endless day;
There with our Saviour, we’ll be forever,
Where no more sorrow can dismay.

3.
Some morning yonder, we'll cease to ponder,
O’er things this life has bro’t to view;
All will be clearer, loved ones be dearer,
In Heav’n where all will be made new.

- Robert S. Arnold
