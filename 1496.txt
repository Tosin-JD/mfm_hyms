I Shall Wear A Golden Crown - 7.4 7.4.6.6.6.4. with Ref.

1.
I shall wear a golden crown,
When I get home;
I shall lay my burdens down,
When I get home;
Clad in robes of glory,
I shall sing the story
Of the Lord who bought me,
When I get home.

CHORUS:
When I get home, When I get home,
All sorrow will be over, When I get home;
When I get home, When I get home,
All sorrow will be over, When I get home.

2.
All the darkness will be past,
When I get home;
I shall see the light at last,
When I get home;
Light from heaven streaming,
O'er my pathway beaming,
Ever guides me onward
Till I get home. [Chorus]

3.
I shall see my Saviour's face,
When I get home;
Sing again of saving grace,
When I get home;
I shall stand before him;
Gladly I'll adore him;
Ever to be with him,
When I get home.
