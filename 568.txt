Melcomba - L.M.

1.
Come, gracious Spirit, heavenly Dove,
With light and comfort from above:
Be Thou our Guardian, Thou our Guide;
Oâ€™er every thought and step preside.

2.
The light of truth to us display,
And make us know find love Thy way;
Plant holy fear in every heart,
That we from God may ne'er depart.

3.
Lead us to Christ, the living way;
Nor let us from His pastures stray:
Lead us to holiness, the road
Which we must take to dwell with
God.

4.
Lead us to heaven, its bliss to share,
Fullness of joy for ever there:
Lead us to God, our final rest,
To be with Him for ever bless'd.

- S. Webbe
