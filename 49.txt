1.
We sing a song of Thy great love
Almighty and glorious God
There's nought Thy power cannot provide
Thy goodness endureth for aye.

2.
In love He created the world,
And He made man to dwell in it
And have dominion over all,
Sing a song to our Creator.

3.
Every day He takes care of us,
He feeds and provides all ourneeds,
Without asking ought of our hand,
Praise our God the giver of all.

4.
He finds us roaming in darkness,
Nor knowing how to worship Him
In His love He showed us the way
Praise His name, our benefactor.

5.
In love He gave Jesus to us
Christ, His only begotten Son
He came to redeem us from sin
We praise Thy great love, our Saviour.

6.
In love He sent His word to us
And this Thy love opened our ears,
And established us in the faith
Sing His wonderful grace to us.

7.
Creation is full of Thy love
Our God, King of the universe,
All join the chorus of His praise
And sing of the love of our God.
