Paulinzelle - 8.7.8.7.D.

1.
Glory to the King of Glory!
Thou has raised Thine only Son
With creation’s Hallelujahs
To Thy bosom and Thy Throne;
And the echo of that triumph
Through the centuries of years,
Gathering strength with lapse of ages,
Falls today upon our ears.

2.
Lo, the Lamb of God, for sinners
On the altar sacrificed,
In the brightness of Thy presence
Lives for ever Lord and Christ.
Lo, our great High Priest is pleading
At the blood-stain’d mercy seat
All the love of His atonement,
Fragrance infinitely sweet.

3.
Jesus, Heir of all things, enters
On His heritage of bliss;
His the glory and the blessing,
His the power, the wisdom His:
Jesus reigns, and warrior angels
Strike their harps and sheathe their swords,
Crowning Him the mighty Victor,
King of kings, and Lord of lords.

4.
Who shall fix decline or limit.
To His government’s increase,
Father of the age of ages,
Prince omnipotent of peace?
Who the infinite horizon
Of His royalty shall spar>,
On the throne of all dominion,
Son of God and Son of Man?

5.
Yea, amen, Thy church triumphant
And Thy pilgrim church on earth
Hail this day of Thine espousals
Through the firmament of glory
Ring their everlasting songs;
Ours are from the desert rising,
Feeble voices, faltering tongues.

6.
God, our God, Thou wilt not leave us
In this far off wilderness,
Lonely mourners for the Bride groom,
Orphan children comfortless:
Send Thy Comforter, the Spirit,
Till our frail hearts heavenward rise,
And we dwell where our Redeemer
Dwells with Thee beyond the skies.

- John Hopkins
