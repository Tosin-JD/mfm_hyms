On the victory side

1.
Our souls cry out, hallelujah!
And our faith enraptured sings,
While we throw to the breeze the standard
Of the mighty King of kings.

CHORUS
On the vict’ry side, on the vict’ry side,
In the ranks of the Lord are we;
On the vict’ry side we will boldly stand,
Till the glory land we see.

2.
Our souls cry out, hallelujah! For
the Lord himself comes near,
And the shout of a royal army On
the battle field we hear.

3.
Our souls cry out, hallelujah!
For the tempter flies apace,
And the chains he has forged are breaking.
Through the power of redeeming grace.

4.
Our souls cry out, hallelujah!
And our hearts beat high with praise.
Unto Him, in whose name we’ll conquer,
And our song of triumph raise.
