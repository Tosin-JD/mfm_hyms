Ash Grove-12.11.12.11.D.

1.
The Master hath come, and He calls us to follow
The track Of the footprints He leaves on our way;
Far over the mountain and through
the deep hollow,The path lead us on to the mansions of day:
The Master hath called us, the children who fear Him,
Who march ‘neath Christ's banner. His own little band;
We love Him and seek Him, we long to be near Him,
And rest in the light of His beautiful land.

2.
The Master hath called us; the road may be dreary,
And dangers and sorrows are strewn on the track;
But God’s Holy Spirit shall comfort the weary;
We follow the Saviour and cannot turn back;
The Master hath called us: though doubt and temptation
May compass our journey, we cheerfully sing:
“Press onward, look upward,” thro’ much tribulation;
The children of Zion must follow their King.

3.
The Master hath called us, in life’s early morning,
With spirits as fresh as the dew on the sod:
We turn from the world, with its smiles and its scorning,
To cast in our lot with the people of God:
The Master hath called us, His sons and His daughters,
We plead for His blessing and trust in His love;
And through the green pastures, beside the still waters.
He'll lead us at last to His kingdom above.
