Those Who Make Their Labour Druggery-8.8.8.D.

1.
Those who make their labour druggery
Do the Lord’s work with idleness.
Those who make religion a cloak
Do not understand work and faith;
They separate what God has so joined;
Diligence with devotedness.

2.
The work we do are established
When it’s done with the Spirit’s zeal
God, who created days and nights
Decreed to rest on the seventh
As we work to redeem the time
Pleases our God whom we worship.

3.
We will rejoice if God gives us
Such labour with enthusiasm,
Because such work that Hecommands
Shall be offering for His glory;
Like saints above as we worship,
It swells our fellowship of love.
