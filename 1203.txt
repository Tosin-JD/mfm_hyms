1203
Let us break bread together

1.
Let us break bread together on our knees;
Let us break bread together on our knees.
When I fall on my knees; With my face to the rising sun,
O Lord have mercy on me.

2.
Let us drink the cup together on our knees;
Let us drink the cup together on our knees;
When I fall on my knees; With my face to the rising sun,
O Lord have mercy on me.

3.
Let us praise God together on our knees;
Let us praise God together on our knees.
When I fall on my knees; With my face to the rising sun,
O Lord have mercy on me.
