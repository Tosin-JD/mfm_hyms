Watching for the dawning

1.
We are watching, we are waiting till
the mists shall clear away,
And our Lord shall come in glory
with His saints in bright array;
When the trump of God resounding
shall be heard on ev’ry shore,
And the dead in Christ shall waken
to be with Him evermore.

CHORUS
We are watching, We are waiting.
For the dawning of that glorious day;
For the coming of our Saviour,
With His saints in bright array.

2.
We are looking, for the coming of
our great and glorious King.
Who shall banish from His presence
every dark and evil thing:
When His justice and His mercy
shall prevail in all the world.
And o’er ev’ry tribe and nation shall
His banner be unfurl’d.

3.
Now by faith we catch a vision of
that glad millenial reign,
And be the ransom’d millions who
shall follow in His train;
And our hearts cry out,
“Come quickly!” that His beauty we may see,
And be with our Lord in glory through a blest eternity.
