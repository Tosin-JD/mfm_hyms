Happy day

1.
Jesus is coming with joy to the sky
Oh, happy day! oh, happy day!
Then all who love Him shall heavenward fly:
Oh, happy day! happy day!
Upward shall fly to the Lord in the air,
Together with Jesus we all shall be there,
Far from the earth, and from sorrow and care
Oh, happy day! happy day!

2.
Parents and children shall then again meet.
Oh, happy day! oh, happy day!
Sisters and brother oh it will be sweet!
Oh, happy day! happy day!
We miss’d them on earth, to Jesus they went;
We love them as ever, their absence lament
Soon we shall meet them, and then, be contented
Oh, happy day! happy day!

3.
Are we all ready, should Jesus nowcall?
Oh, happy day! oh, happy day!
Would each one answer, the great and the small?
Oh, happy day! happy day!
We long to rise up and with Thee to be,
Thy face, blessed Jesus our Saviour to see.
Would you then dear children, sing sweetly with me
Oh, happy day! happy day!

4.
Some will stay weeping, unable to sing,
Oh, happy day oh, happy day!
“Yet ail may rejoice and their glad praises bring”
Oh, happy day! happy day!
For Jesus still waits. He tarries that
We may trust in His name, and thus ready may be.
When, brightly beaming, His glory we see:
Oh happy day! happy day!
