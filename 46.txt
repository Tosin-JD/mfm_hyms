Laudes Domini -6.6.6.6.6.6.

1.
When morning gilds the skies,
My heart awaking cries,
May Jesus Christ be praised!
Alike at work and prayer
To Jesus I repair,
May Jesus Christ be praised!

2.
Does sadness fill my mind?
A solace here I find, May
Jesus Christ be praised!
Or fades my earthly bliss?
My comfort still is this.
May Jesus Christ be praised!

3.
The night becomes as day,
When from the heart we say,
May Jesus Christ be praised!
The pow’rs of darkness fear
When this sweet chant they hear,
May Jesus Christ be praised!

4.
Ye nations of mankind,
In this your concord find,
May Jesus Christ be praised!
Let all the earth around
Ring joyous with the sound,
May Jesus Christ be praised!

5.
Sing, suns and stars of space,
Sing ye that see His face,
May Jesus Christ be praised!
God’s whole creation o’er,
For aye and evermore
May Jesus Christ be praised!

6.
Be this, while life is mine,
My canticle divine,
May Jesus Christ be praised!
Be this th'eternal song
Thro’ all the ages long,
May Jesus Christ be praised!
