THE LORD OF MIGHT FROM SINAI'S BROW

1.
The Lord of might from Sinai's brow
Gave forth His voice of thunder;
And Israel lay on earth below
Outstretch'd in fear and wonder
Beneath His feet was pitchy night
And at His left hand and His right
The rocks were rent asunder.

2.
The Lord of love on Calvary,
A meek and suffering stranger,
Upraised to heaven His languid eye
In nature's hour of danger;
For us He bore the weight of woe,
For us He gave His blood to flow,
And met His Father's anger.

3.
The Lord of love and of might,
The King of all created,
Shall back return to claim His right.
On clouds of glory seated;
With trumpet-sound, and angel song
And Hallelujahs loud and long,
O’er death and hell defeated.
