412
Follow, I Will Follow Thee

1.
Jesus calls me, I must follow,
Follow Him to day;
When His tender voice is pleading
How can I delay?

CHORUS
Follow, I will follow Thee, my Lord,
Follow ev’ry passing day;
My tomorrows are all known to Thee,
Thou wilt lead me all the way.

2.
Jesus calls me, I must follow,
Follow ev’ry hour,
Know the blessing of His presence,
Fullness of His pow’r.

3.
Jesus calls me, I must follow,
Follow Him always;
When my Saviour goes before me
I can never stray.
