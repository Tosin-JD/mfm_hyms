When the door is shut

1.
When the door is shut it will be too late;
Enter while you may, enter in today;
Why live on in sin? why in danger wait?

CHORUS
Enter while you may, while you may!
Oh, enter, enter in today!
Oh, enter, enter while you may’
Do the Saviour’s bidding, lest you hear him say,
‘The door is shut! Too late! too late!

2.
When the door is shut all your hopes will die;
Enter while you may, enter in today;
Vainly then to heav’n you for help will cry;

3.
When the door is shut mercy’s calls will cease;
Enter while you may, enter in today;
Hasten, needy one, with thy God make peace;

4.
When the door is shut count the dreadful cost;
Enter while you may, enter in today;
Oh, the shut out soul all’s for ever lost;
