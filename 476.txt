St. Albinus -7.8.7.8.4.

1.
Jesus lives! thy terrors now
Can no more, O death, appal us;
Jesus lives! by this we know
Thou, O rave, canst not enthral us.
Alleluia!

2.
Jesus lives! henceforth is death
But the gate of life immortal:
This shall calm our trembling
breath,
When we pass its gloomy portal.
Alleluia!

3.
Jesus lives! for us he died;
Then, alone to Jesus living,
Pure in heart may we abide,
Glory to our Saviour giving.
Alleluia!

4.
Jesus lives! our hearts know well
Naught from us his love shall sever;
Life nor death nor power of hell
Tear us from his keeping ever.
Alleluia!

5.
Jesus lives! to him the throne
Over all the world is given:
May we go where he is gone,
Rest and reign with him in heaven.
Alleluia!

- C. F. Gellert
