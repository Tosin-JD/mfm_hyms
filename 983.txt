Will you quit the filed

1. 
Will you quit the field?
Will you ever yield?
Will you boldly fight,
And defend the right?
Never, never, never!
Yes, for ever!

CHORUS
Never quit the field till the foe is slain,
Never quit the field, oh, never, never yield;
Never quit the field till we vict’rygain,
Never, never, never!

2.
When the foe is near
Will you have a fear?
Never, never, never!
Will you take your stand
With faith’s sword in hand?
Yes, for ever!

3.
Will you cease to sing
Praises to your King?
Never, never, never!
Bravely every day
Will you march away?
Yes, for ever!
