1.
Thee will I love, my strength, my tower:
Thee will I love, my joy, my crown; -
Thee will I love with all my power,
In all Thy works, and Thee alone;
Thee will I love till sacred fire
Fills my whole soul with pure desire.

2.
I thank Thee, uncreated Sun,
That Thy bright beams on me have shined;
I thank Thee, who hast overthrown
My foes, and heal'd my wounded mind;
I thank Thee, whose enlivening voice
Bids my freed heart in Thee rejoice.

3.
Uphold me in the doubtful race,
Nor suffer my feet again to stray;
Strengthen my feet with heavenly grace
Still to press forward in Thy way:
That all my powers, with all their might,
In Thy sole glory may unite.

4.
Thee will I love, my joy, my crown;
Thee will I love, my Lord, my God;
Thee will I love, beneath Thy frown
Or smile Thy sceptre or Thy rod;
What though my flesh and heart decay,
Thee shall I love in endless day.
