David - D. C. M.

1.
O, David was a shepherd lad,
And guarded well the sheep;
By night and day, good times or bad,
His watch he used to keep.
But David’s less than David’s Son,
Though a Shepherd too is he;
Through all the world his pastures run,
And of his flock are we.

2.
O, David was a shepherd lad,
And more he dared to do:
Goliath all in armour clad
With sling and stone he slew.
But David's Son, more daring yet,
Put weapons all away;
All evil things with goodness met,
And stronger was than they.

3.
O, David was a shepherd lad,
And a kingdom he attained;
And gold and glory great he had,
And forty years he reigned.
But David’s Son is rich in love,
And reigns eternally;
For King he is in heaven above,
And on the earth shall be.
