Lifetime is Working Time

1.
Lifetime is working time, Spend no idle days;
Jesus is calling thee On the harvest ways.
Working with a willing hand, Sing a song of praise;
Work, ever work for Jesus!

CHORUS
Swiftly the hours of labour fly,
Freighted with love let each pass by!
There is joy in labour for the struggling neighbour,
Work, ever work for Jesus!

2.
Lifetime is working time, Learn where duty lies;
Grasp ev’ry passing day 
As a precious prize,
Glad to help the sorrowing, Glad to sympathize;
Work, ever work for Jesus!

3.
Lifetime is working time, Do thy honest part;
Tho' in discouragements Bear a cheerful heart,
Trusting Jesus as thy Friend, Ne’er from Him depart,
Work, ever work for Jesus!
