Hallowed Day and Holy

1.
Hallowed Day and Holy
thou holy day of rest
We ought to give one full day
to God, the good and kind
Other days bring the tear drops
thou wipes the tears away
Thou art a day of gladness
I love thy happy morn.

CHORUS
Hallowed day and Holy
there is no work today
we will suspend our labour
Until tomorrow's day
How beautiful and how bright
Thou blessed day of rest
Other days speak of troubles
But thou give hope of rest

2.
Hallowed Day and Holy
Here how the Church bell says
Give one day to thy Maker
who gave to you six days.
We shall take leave of labour
Togo and worship there
Both we and all our dear friends
On to the house of pray'r

3.
Hallowed Day and Holy
thy hour delights me so
A taste of heav'n you give us
Like that eternal rest
Lord, let me be partaker
Of rest beyond the grave
To sing and serve Thee ever
With all Thy saints above.s
