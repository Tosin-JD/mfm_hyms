Trust

1.
All that our Saviour hath spoken
Came from the heart of God;
Surely it cannot be broken,
Seal’d with His precious blood.

CHORUS
Tempests may rage and thunder,
Mountains be rent asunder,
Nations may fear and wonder
Trust, and be undismay’d.

2.
As unto Abram was given
God’s cov'nant word of peace,
“Counting the stars” of the even
So shall thy faith increase.

3.
Trust when the light warm and
tender
Seemeth to thee withdrawn;
Wait a few hours, and in splendour
Morning again will dawn!

4.
When in the fires of affliction,
Fully in Him confide;
Jesus will speak benediction,
Walking His saint beside.

5.
Trust! tho all others forsake thee,
Yet there remains one Friend;
Mercy and truth shall o'ertake thee
Down to thy journey’s end.

6.
Trust under ev’ry condition
Till thou shalt reach thy home;
Trust, till in perfection
That which is real hath come.

- Thoro Harris
