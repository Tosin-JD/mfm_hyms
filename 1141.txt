The Sure Foundation

1.
There stands a Rock on shores of time
That rears to heav’n its head sublime;
That Rock is cleft, and they are blest
Who find within this cleft a rest.

CHORUS
Some build their hopes on the ever drifting sand,
Some on their fame, or their treasure, or their land;
Mine's on a Rock that forever will stand,
Jesus, the "Rock of Ages.”

2.
That Rock’s a cross, its arms outspread,
Celestial glory bathes its head;
To its firm base my all I bring,
And to the rock of ages cling.

3.
That Rock's a tower, whose lofty height,
Illum’d with heav’n unclouded light,
Opens wide its gate beneath the dome
Where saints find rest with Christ at home.
