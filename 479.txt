Nonington - 8.7.8.3.

1.
On the resurrection morning
Soul and body meet again;
No more sorrow, no more weeping,
No more pain.

2.
Here awhile they must be parted;
And the flash its Sabbath keep.
Waiting in a holy stillness
Wrapt in sleep.

3.
Soul and body reunited
Thenceforth nothing shall divide,
Waking up in Christâ€™s own likeness
Satisfied.

4.
O the beauty, O the gladness
Of that resurrection day,
Which shall not through endless ages
Pass away!

5.
To that brightest of all meetings
Bring us, Jesus Christ, at last;
To Thy cross, through death and judgement,
Holding fast.

- S. Baring Gould
