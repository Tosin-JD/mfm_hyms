Sarah Rachel - 8.8.8.8.

1.
Eternal light, shine in my heart,
eternal hope, lift up my eyes;
eternal power, be my support,
eternal wisdom, make me wise.

2.
Eternal life, raise me from death,
eternal brightness, help me see;
eternal Spirit, give me breath,
eternal Saviour, come to me:

3.
Until by your most costly grace,
invited by your holy word,
at last I come before your face
to know you, my eternal God.

- Christopher Idle
