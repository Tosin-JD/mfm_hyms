Autumn - 8.7.8.7.D.

1.
There’s a light upon the mountains,
And the day is at the spring.
When our eyes shall see the beauty
And the glory of the King;
Weary was our heart with waiting,
And the night watch seemed so long,
But His triumph day is breaking,
And we hail it with a song.

2.
In the fading of the star-light
We may see the coming morn;
And the lights of men are paling
In the splendours of the dawn;
For the eastern skies are glowing
As with light of hidden fire,
And the hearts of men are stiring
With the throbs of deep desire.

3.
There’s a hush of expectation
And a quiet in the air,
And the breath of God is moving
In the fervent breath of prayer;
For the suffering, dying Jesus
Is the Christ upon the throne,
And the travail of our spiritIs the travail of His own.

4.
Hark! we hear a distant music,
And it comes with fuller swell;
‘Tis the triumph song of Jesus,
Of our King, Immanuel!
Go ye forth with joy to meet Him!
And, my soul, be swift to bring
All thy sweetest and thy dearest
For the triumph of our King!
