We’re The Army

1.
We’re the Soldiers of The Army of Salvation,
That God is raising now to save the world;
And we won’t lay down our arms till ev’ry nation
Shall have seen the Flag of Blood and Fire unfurled.

CHORUS
We’re The Army that shall conquer
As we go seek the lost,
And to bring them back to God;
And His Salvation to ev’ry nation
We will carry with the Fire and the Blood.

2.
Though the hosts of Hell and darkness all surround us,
And by suffering and temptation we are tried,
Well we know that not a foe can e’er confound us,
While Jehovah’s mighty power is on our side.

3.
So we’ll put our trust in God, who ne’er will fail us,
And we know that His Salvation we shall see;
And through all the fighting, those who shall assail us
Shall be conquered through the Blood of Calvary.

- T. C. Marshall
