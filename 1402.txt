1.
Hark! The sound of holy voices,
Chanting at the crystal sea:
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
Hallelujah! Lord, to Thee:
Multitude, which none can number,
Like the stars in glory stand.
Clothed in white apparel, holding
Palms of victory in their hand.

2.
They have come from tribulation,
And have washed their robes in blood,
Washed them in the blood of Jesus;
Tried they were, and firm they stood;
Mocked, imprisoned, stoned, tormented,
Sawn asunder, slain with sword.
They have conquered death and Satan
By the might of Christ the Lord.

3.
Marching with Thy Cross their
banner.
They have triumphed, following
Thee, the Captain of salvation.
Thee, their Saviour and their king
Gladly, Lord, with Thee they
suffered;
Gladly, Lord, with Thee they died:
And by death, to life immortal
They were born and glorified.

4.
God of God .the One-begotten.
Light of Light. Immanuel.
In whose body joined together
All the saints for ever dwell.
Pour upon us of Thy fullness.
That we may for evermore
God the Father, God the Son, and
God the Holy Ghost adore.

- Christopher Wordsworth
