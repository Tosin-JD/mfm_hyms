Portrush-11.11.11.12.

1.
We are little children,
very young indeed,
But the Saviour’s promise
each of us may plead.

CHORUS
If we seek Him early,
if we come today,
We can be His little friends.
He has said we may.

2.
Little friends of Jesus,
what a happy thought!
What a precious promise
in the Bible taught!

3.
Little friends of Jesus,
walking by His side,
With His arm around
us ev’ry step to guide.

4. 
We must love Him dearly
with a constant love,
Then we’ll go and see Him
in our home above.

- Fanny J. Crosby
