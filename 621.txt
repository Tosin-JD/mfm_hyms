THERE’S A GREAT DAY COMING


1.
There's a great day coming, A great day coming,
There’s a great day coming by and by;
When the saints and the sinners shall
be parted right and left,
Are you ready for that day to come?

CHORUS
Are you ready? Are you ready?
Are you ready for the judgement day?
Are you ready? Are you ready
for that judgement day?

2.
There’s a bright day coming,
A bright day coming,
There’s a bright day coming by andby;
But it s brightness shall only come
to them that love the Lord,
Are you ready for that day to come?

3.
There’s a sad day coming,
A sad day coming,
There's a sad day coming by and by;
When the sinner shall hear his doom,
“Depart I know ye not,”
Are you ready for that day to come?
