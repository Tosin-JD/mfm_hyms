O SHOUT ALOUD THE TIDINGS


1.
O shout aloud the tidings,
Repeat the joyful strain;
Let all the waiting nations
This message hear again:
The spotless Lamb of glory
Who once for man was slain.
Soon o’er all the earth shall reign.

CHORUS
Looking for that blessed hope,
Looking for that blessed hope;
We know the hour is nearing,
The hour of His appearing:
We’re looking for that blessed hope.

2.
Signs in the heav’n above us,
In sun and moon and sky,
Proclaim to all the faithful
Redemption draweth nigh;
The heart of men are quaking,
And failing them for fear:
Jesus coming draweth near.

3.
We’ll watch for His returning
With lamps well trimmed and bright;
He cometh to the careless
As thieves break through at night;
“Well done, thou good and faithful”
O may we hear the word,
