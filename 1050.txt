Whither, Pilgrims, Are You Going - 8.7.8.7.8.8.8.7.8.7.

1.
Whither, pilgrims, are you going,
Going each with staff in hand?
We are going on a journey,
Going at our King's command,
Over hills and plains and valleys,
We are going to His palace,
We are going to His palace,
Going to the better land;
We are going to His palace,
Going to the better land.

2.
Tell us, pilgrims, what you hope for
In that far-off, better land?
Spotless robes, and crowns of glory,
From a Saviourâ€™s loving hand,
We shall drink of life's clear river,
We shall dwell with God for ever,
We shall dwell with God for ever,
In that bright, that better land,
We shall dwell with God for ever,
In that bright, that better land.

3.
Doth ye not fear the way ye trod
O yet little pilgrim band
The Friend unseen goeth with us
Angels doth surround us still
Jesus Christ our Lord doth guide us,
He shall watch us, He shall lead us,
He shall watch us, He shall lead us,
On this holy pilgrimage,
He shall watch us, He shall lead us,
On this holy pilgrimage.

4.
Pilgrims, may we travel with you
TO that bright and better land?
Come and welcome, come and welcome
Welcome to our pilgrim band.
Come, oh, come! and don't leave us;
Christ is waiting to receive us,
Christ is waiting to receive us,
In that bright, that better land.
Christ is waiting to receive us,
In that bright, that better land.

- Fanny Crosby
