O God, I Know That Thou Art Mine - C. M.

1.
O God, I know that Thou art mine
And I will not leave Thee,
Till all I have become Thine own
And I shall be renewed.

2.
I hold to thee with trembling hands
And I will not leave Thee;
Till in the faith, I’m established
And Thy goodness I know.

3.
When will the moment come, O Lord
When Thou will dwell in me;
Spirit of life and pow'r and might
And of perfect wisdom.

4.
Lord let the triumph of Thy love
Be shed abroad within
That my feet may ne’er go astray
But, be grounded in Thee.

5.
Thy Holy flame, grant that it may
Light up within my heart;
To bum the dross of wicked lust
And melt the heart of stone.

6.
Let Thy fire come down from above
And consume all my sins
Come, Holy Spirit, hear my cry
Come, Thou Spirit of fire.

7.
Refining fire, come to my heart,
Shed Thou Thy light abroad
Fill me within with Thy Spirit
Consecrated to Thee.
