When the Tithes are gathered in

1.
There’ll be show’rs of blessing from our Father's hand,
On His word of promise we may firmly stand;
There’ll be rains refreshing on the thirsty land
When the tithes are gather’d in.

CHORUS
Tithes of love and willing service,
Tithes of silver and of gold;
When the tithes are gather’d in,
When the tithes are gather’d in
There’ll be blessings more than we can contain,
When the tithes are gather’d in.

2.
There’ll be shouts of triumph from
the conq’ring host,
There’ll be perfect freedom in the
Holy Ghost; "
Ev’ry one empower’d as at Pentecost,
When the tithes are gather’d in.

3.
Then will come the dawning of the reign of peace,
When the wars and conflicts shall forever cease,
And for struggling saints shall come a sweet release,
When the tithes are gathered in.

4.
We will rob no longer, then, our Lord and King,
What to Him belongeth we will gladly bring,
And we'll shout hosanna, while the glad harps ring,
When the tithes are gathered in.
