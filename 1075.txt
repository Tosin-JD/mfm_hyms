Hallelujah! tis done

1.
‘Tis the promise of God full salvation to give
Unto him who on Jesus,
His Son, will believe.

CHORUS
Hallelujah! ‘tis done, I believe on the Son;
I am saved by the blood of the Crucified One.
Hallelujah 'tis done, I believe on the Son;
I am saved by the blood of the Crucified One.

2.
Tho’ the pathway be
lonely and dangerous too,
Surely Jesus is able
to carry me thro’.

3.
Many loved ones have
I in yon heavenly throng,
They are safe now in glory,
and this is their song.

4.
There are prophets and
kings in that throng I behold,
And they sing while they march through
the streets of pure gold.

5.
There’s a part in that
Chorus for you and for me,
And the theme of our praises
for ever will be:

- P. P. Bliss
