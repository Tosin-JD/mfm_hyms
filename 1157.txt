Filitz - 6.5.6.5.

1.
O Let him whose sorrow
No relief can find,
Trust in God, and borrow
Ease for heart-and mind.

2.
Where the mourner, weeping,
Sheds the secret tear,
God His watch is keeping.
Though none else be near.

3.
God will never leave thee;
All thy wants He knows,
Feels the pains that grieve thee,
Sees thy cares and woes.

4.
If in grief thou languish.
He will dry the tear,
Who His childrenâ€™s anguish
Soothes with succour near.

5.
All thy woe and sadness,
In this world below,
Balance not the gladness
Thou in heaven shalt know,

6.
When thy gracious Saviour,
In the realms above,
Crowns thee with His favour,
Fills thee with His love.

- Heinrich Siegmund Oswald
