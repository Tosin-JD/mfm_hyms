The Blood Will Never Lose Its Power

1.
The blood that Jesus shed for me way back on Calvary;
The blood that gives me strength from day to day,
It will never lose its power

CHORUS
It reaches to the highest mountain
It flows to the lowest valley
the blood that gives me strength from day to day
It will never lose its power,

2.
It soothes my doubts and calms my fears,
And it dries all my tears;
The blood that gives me strength from day to day,
It will never lose its power.
