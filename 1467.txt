Sleep On, Beloved, Sleep And Take Thy Rest - P.M.

1.
Sleep on, beloved, sleep and take thy rest;
Lay down thy head upon thy Saviour's Breast;
We love thee well, but Jesus loves thee best;
Good night, good night, good night!

2.
Calm is thy slumber as an infant’s sleep;
But thou shall wake no more to toil and weep,
Thine is a perfect rest, secure and deep:
Good night, good night, good night!

3.
Until the shadows from this earth
are cast,Until He gathers in His sheaves at last,
Until the twilight gloom is overpassed,
Good night, good night, good night!

4.
Until the Lord’s new glory flood the skies
Until the loved in Jesus shall arise,
And He shall come, but not in lowly guise,
Good night, good night, good night!

5.
Until, made beautiful by Love Divine
Thou in the likeness of thy Lord shalt shine,
And He shall bring that golden crown of thine
Good night, good night, good night!

6.
Only “Good night!” beloved not "Farewell!”
A little while and all His Saints shall dwell
In hallowed union, indivisible:
Good night, good night, good night!

7.
Until we meet and all his before His Throne,
Clothed in the spotless robe He gives His own,
Until we know, even as we are known,
Good night, good night, good night!
