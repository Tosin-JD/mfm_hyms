Moravia -S.M.

1.
Welcome, sweet day of rest,
That saw the Lord arise;
Welcome to this reviving breast,
And these rejoicing eyes.

2.
The King Himself comes near,
And feasts His saints today;
Here we may seek and see Him
here,
And love, and praise, and pray.

3.
One day of prayer and praise
His sacred courts within,
Is sweeter than ten thousand days
Of pleasurable sin.

4.
My willing soul would stay
In such a frame as this;
And wait to hail the brighter day
Of everlasting bliss.

- L. R. West
