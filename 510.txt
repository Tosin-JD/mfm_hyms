St. Basil The Great - 7.6.7.6.D.

1.
O Christ, Thou hast ascended
Triumphantly on high,
By cherub guards attended
And armies of the sky:
Let earth tell forth the story,
Our very flesh and bone,
Emmanuel in glory,
Ascends His Father’s throne.

2.
Heaven’s gates unfold above Thee:
But canst Thou, forget
The little band who love Thee
And gaze from Olivet?
Nay, on Thy breast engraven
Thou bearest every name,
Our Priest in earth and heaven
Eternally the same.

1.
There, there Thou standest pleading
The virtue of Thy blood,
For sinners interceding,
Our Advocate with God;
And every changeful fashion
Of our brief joys and cares
Finds thought in Thy compassion
And echo in Thy prayers.

2.
Oh, for the priceless merit
Of Thy redeeming cross,
Vouchsafe Thy sevenfold Spirit
And turn to gain our loss;
Till we by strong endeavour
In heart and mind ascend
And dwell with Thee for ever
In glories without end.

- C. V. Stanford
