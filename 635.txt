When The Trump Of The Great Archangel

1.
When the trump of the great archangel
It mighty tones shall sound
And, the end of the world proclaiming,
Shall pierce the depths profound;
When the Son of Man shall come in His glory,
With all the saints on high,
What a shouting in the skies from the multitudes that rise
Changed in the twinkling of an eye.

CHORUS
Changed in the twinkling of an eye,
Changed in the twinkling of an eye;
The trumpet shall sound, the dead shall be raised,
Changed in the twinkling of an eye.

2.
When He come in the clouds descending,
And they who loved Him here,
From their graves shall awake and praise Him
With Joy and not with fear;
When the body and the soul are united,
And clothed no more to die,
What a shouting there will be
When each other's face we see,
Changed in the twinkling of an eye.

3.
Oh the seed that was sown in weakness
Shall then be raised in power,
And the songs of the blood-bought millions
Shall hail that blissful hour;
When we gather safely home in themorning,
And nightâ€™s dark shadows fly,
What a shouting on the shore
When we meet to part no more.
