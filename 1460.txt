Ashbrooke - 6.6.

1.
There is a blessed home
Beyond this lanclof woe,
Where trials never come,
Nor tears of sorrow flow;
Where faith is lost in sight,
And patient hope is crown'd,
And everlasting light
Its glory throws around.

2.
There is a land of peace,
Good angels know it well;
Glad songs that never cease
Within its portals swell;
Around its glorious throne
Ten thousand saints adore
Christ, with the Father One,
And Spirit evermore.

3.
Oh joy all joys beyond,
To see the Lamb who died,
For ever there enthroned,
For ever glorified;
To give to Him the praise
Of every triumph won,
And sing through endless days
The great things He hath done.

4.
Lookup, ye saints of God,
Nor fear to tread below
The path your Saviour trod
Of daily toil and woe;
Wait but a little while
In uncomplaining love,
His own most gracious smile
Shall welcome you above.

- George F. Vincent
