More Abundantly

1.
Are you trusting Jesus, All along the way?
Does He grow more precious to your heart each day?
Are you His disciple? Test His word and see,
He will give the Spirit More abundantly.

CHORUS
More abundantly, more abundantly,
‘That they might have life, and more abundantly;”
More abundantly, more abundantly
That they might have life, and more abundantly.”

2.
For His matchless favour Magnify the name
Of our gracious Saviour Who from glory came;
Let the saints adore Him For this wondrous word,
Sealing our redemption Thro’ the crimson flood.

3.
Come to Him believing, Hark to His call’
All from Him receiving, Yield to Him your all,
Jesus will accept you When to Him you flee;
He will grant His blessing More abundantly.
