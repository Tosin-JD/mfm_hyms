Wonderful Peace
1 Faraway in the depths of my spirit tonight
Rolls a melody sweeter than psalm;
In celestial like strains it unceasingly
falls
O'er my soul like an infinite calm
CHORUS
Peace! Peace! Wonderful peace,
Coming down from the Father
above;
Sweep over my spirit forever, I pray,In fathomless billows of love.

2.
What a treasure I have in this
wonderful peace,
Buried deep in the heart of my soul;
So secure that no power can mine it away,
While the years of eternity roll.

3.
I am resting tonight in this wonderful peace,
Resting sweetly in Jesus' control;
For Iâ€™m kept from all danger by
night and by day,
And His glory is flooding my soul.

4.
And I think when I rise to that City of peace,
Where the Author of peace I shall see,
That one strain of the song which
the ransomed will sing,
In that heavenly kingdom shall be:

5.
Ah! soul, are you here without
comfort or rest,
Marching down the rough pathway
of time?
Make Jesus your friend ere the
shadows grow dark;
Oh, accept this sweet peace so
sublime.
