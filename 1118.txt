Thou Hast Snapped My Fetters - 11.11.11.11.

1.
Thou hast snapped my fetters; Thou hast made me
Liberty and gladness, I have found in Thee;
Liberty from bondage, from my weary load, free;
Satan's slave no longer now a child of God.

CHORUS
I am Thine, Lord Jesus, Ever Thine, Thine I am,
And my heart is singing, Glory to the Lamb.

2.
Living in the sunshine, shining in Thy light,
Fighting as Thy soldier, mighty in Thy might;
Going on Thy mission, pointing men to Thee,
Telling of the Saviour who can set them free.

3.
Such the life, Lord Jesus, I would ever live.
Such the grateful tribute I would ever give;
Witnessing for Thee, Lord, everywhere I go,
Of the Blood that cleanseth, washing white as snow.

4.
And when life is ended, when the vict’ry’s won,
When I hear from Thee, Lord, the glad words. “Well done.”
With what joy and rapture shall I sing of Thee,
Who from sin’s dark chains didst set my spirit free!
