Leavell - S.M. with Refrain

1.
Arise. O youth of God!
Have done with lesser things;
Give heart and soul and mind and
strengthTo serve the King of kings.

CHORUS
Arise, arise. The Master calls for thee;
Arise, arise. O youth of God.
March on to victory!

2.
Arise, O youth of God!
His kingdom tarries long;
Bring in the day of joy and peace,
And end the night of wrong

3.
Arise, O youth of God!
The church for you doth wait;
Her strength shall make your spirit strong;
Her service make you great.

4.
Lift high the cross of Christ!
Tread where His feet have trod;
Be loyal to the King of kings;
March on, O youth of God!
