Glorious Name - 8.7.8.7. with Refrain

1.
Blessed Saviour, we adore Thee,
We Thy love and grace proclaim;
Thou art mighty, Thou art holy,
Glorious is Thy matchless name!

CHORUS
Glorious (Glorious is Thy name, O Lord!)
Glorious (Glorious is Thy name, O Lord!)
Glorious is Thy name, O Lord! Glorious
(Glorious is Thy name, 0 Lord!)
Glorious (Glorious is Thy name, O Lord!)
Glorious is Thy name, O Lord!

2.
Great Redeemer, Lord and Master,
Light of all eternal days;
Let the saints of every nation Sing
Thy just and endless praise!

3.
From the throne of heaven's glory
To the cross of sin and shame,
Thou didst come to die a ransom,
Guilty sinners to reclaim!

4.
Come, O come, immortal Saviour,
Come and take Thy royal throne;
Come, and reign, and reign forever,
Be the kingdom all Thine own!
