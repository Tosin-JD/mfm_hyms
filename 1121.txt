What Though Clouds Are Hovering O’er Me - 8.7.8.7.D.

1.
What though clouds are hovering o’er me.
And I seem to walk alone,
Longing, 'mid my cares and crosses,
For the joys that now are flown!
If I’ve Jesus, “Jesus only,”
Then my sky will have a gem;
He’s the Sun of brightest splendour,
And the star of Bethlehem.

2.
What though all my earthly journey
Bringeth naught but weary hours;
And, in grasping for life’s roses,
Thorns I find instead of flow’rs!
If I’ve Jesus, “Jesus only,”
I possess a cluster rare;
He’s the “Lily of the Valley,”
And the “Rose of Sharon” fair.

3.
What though all my heart isyearning
For the loved of long ago,
Bitter lessons sadly learning
From the shadowy page of woe!
If I’ve Jesus, “Jesus only,”
He’ll be with me to the end;
And, unseen by mortal vision,
Angel bands will o’er me bend.

4.
When I soar to realms of glory,
And an entrance I await,
If I whisper, "Jesus only!”
Wide will open the pearly gate;
When I join the heavenly chorus,
And the angel hosts I see,
Precious Jesus, "Jesus only,”
Will my theme of rapture be.
