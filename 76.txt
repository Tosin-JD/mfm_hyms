Rejoice In the Lord - 8.8.8.8. with Refrain

1.
Be glad in the Lord, and rejoice,
All ye that are upright in heart;
And ye that have made Him your choice,
Bid sadness and sorrow depart.

CHORUS
Rejoice! rejoice!
Be glad in the Lord and rejoice!
Rejoice! rejoice!
Be glad in the Lord and rejoice!

2.
Be joyful, for He is the Lord,
On earth and in heaven supreme;
He fashions and rules by His word;
The ‘Mighty’ and 'Strong' to redeem.

3.
What tho’ in the conflict for right
Your enemies almost prevail!
God’s armies, just hid from your sight,
Are more than the foes which assail.

4.
Tho’ darkness surround you by day,
Your sky by the night be o’ercast,
Let nothing your spirit dismay,
But trust till the danger is past.

5.
Be glad in the Lord, and rejoice,
His praises proclaiming in song;
With harp, and with organ, and voice.
The loud hallelujahs prolong!
