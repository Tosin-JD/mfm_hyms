O To Be Like Thee

1.
O to be like Thee! Blessed Redeemer,
This is my constant longing and
prayer;
Gladly I'll forfeit all of earth’s
treasures,
Jesus Thy perfect likeness to wear.
CHORUS
0 to be like Thee! 0 to be like
Thee,
Blessed Redeemer, pure as Thou
art!
Come in Thy sweetness, come in
Thy fullness;
Stamp Thine own image deep on
my heart.

2.
O to be like Thee! Full of compassion,
Loving, forgiving, tender and kind;
Helping the helpless, cheering the
fainting,
Seeking the wand’ring sinner to find.

3.
O to be like Thee! Lowly in spirit,
Holy and harmless, patient and brave;
Meekly enduring cruel reproaches,
Willing to suffer others to save.

4.
O to be like Thee! Lord, I am coming
Now to receive th'anointing divine;
All that I am and have I am bringing,
Lord, from this moment all shall be
Thine.

5.
O to be like Thee! While I am
pleading,
Pour out Thy Spirit, fill with Thy love;
Make me a temple meet for Thydwelling,
Fit me for life and heaven above.

- Thomas O. Chisholm
