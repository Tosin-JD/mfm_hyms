Regent square - 8.7.8.7.4.7.

1.
Hark! the gospel news is sounding,
Christians suffered on the tree;
Streams of mercy are abounding,
Grace for all is rich and free.
Now, poor sinner, Now, poor sinner,
Come to Him who died for thee.

2.
Oh! escapes to yonder mountain,
Refuge find in Him today;
Christ invites you to the fountain,
Come and wash your sins away;
Do not tarry, Do not tarry,
Come to Jesus while you may.

3.
Grace is flowing like a river,
Millions there have been supplied;
Still it flows as fresh as ever
From the Saviour’s wounded side;
None need perish,
All may live, for Christ hath died.

4.
Christ alone shall be our portion;
Soon we hope to meet above;
Then we'll bathe in the full ocean
Of the great Redeemer’s love;
All His fullness
We shall then forever prove.
