Caswall - 6.5.6.5.

1.
Jesus, stand among us
in your risen power;
let this time of worship
be a hallowed hour.

2.
Breathe the Holy Spirit
into every heart;
bid the fears and sorrows
from each soul depart.

3.
Thus with quickened footsteps
weâ€™ll pursue our way
watching for the dawning
of the eternal day.

- W. Pennefather
