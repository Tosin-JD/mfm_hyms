Open wide the door - 7.7.7.5,

1.
Jesus knocks: He calls to thee
"Weary one, oh come to Me!"
He can save, and only He:
Open wide the door!

CHORUS
Open wide the door!
Open wide the door!
He can save, and only He:
Open wide the door!

2.
Jesus knocks: He comes to save
‘Twas for thee His life He gave;
He hath triumph’d o’er the grave:
Open wide the door!

3.
Jesus knocks, is knocking still:
Yield to Him at once thy will;
He with joy thy heart can fill:
Open wide the door!

4.
Jesus knocks, the moments fly;
While salvation yet is nigh,
Ere the Saviour passeth by,
Open wide the door!
