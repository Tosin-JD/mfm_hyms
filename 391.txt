1.
I have one deep, supreme desire,
That I may be like Jesus.
To this I fervently aspire,
That I may be like Jesus.
I want my heart His throne to be,
So that a watching world may see
His likeness shining forth in me.
I want to be like Jesus.

2.
He spent His life in doing good;
I want to be like Jesus.
In lowly paths of service trod;
I want to be like Jesus.
He sympathized with hearts distressed;
He spoke the words that cheered and blessed;
He welcomed sinners to His breast.
I want to be like Jesus.

3.
A holy, harmless life He led;
I want to be like Jesus.
The Father’s will, His drink andbread:
I want to be like Jesus.
And when at last He comes to die,
“Forgive them, Father," hear Him
For those who taunt and crucify.
I want to be like Jesus.

4.
Oh, perfect life of Christ, my Lord!
I want to be like Jesus.
My recompense and my reward,
That I may be like Jesus.
His spirit fill my hung’ring soul,
His power all my life control;
My deepest pray'r, my highest goal,
That I may be like Jesus.
