Jesus Loves Me - 7.7.7.7. with Refrain

1.
Jesus loves me, this | know,
For the Bible tells me so;
Little ones to Him belong,
They are weak, but He is strong.

CHORUS
Yes, Jesus loves me,
Yes, Jesus loves me,
Yes, Jesus loves me,
The Bible tells me so.

2.
Jesus loves me! He who died
Heaven's gate to open wide;
He. will wash away my sin.
Let His little child come in.

3.
Jesus loves me! He will stay
Close beside me all the way,
Then His little child will take
Up to heaven, for His dear sake.
