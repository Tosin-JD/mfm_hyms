Winchester Old - C.M.

1.
Come, Holy Ghost, our hearts inspire,
Let us Thine influence prove;
Source of the old prophetic fire,
Fountain of light and love.

2.
Come, Holy Ghost, for, mov’d by Thee,
The prophets wrote and spoke;
Unlock the truth, Thy-self the Key,
Unseal the sacred book.

3.
Expand Thy wings, celestial Dove,
Brood o’er our nature’s night;
On our disorder’d spirits move,
And let there now be light.

4.
God, thro' Himself, we then shall know,
If Thou within us shine;
And sound, with all Thy saints below,
The depths of love divine.

- Charles Wesley
