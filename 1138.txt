Solid Rock-8.8.8.8.8.8.8.

1.
My hope is built on nothing less
Than Jesus’ blood and righteousness;
I dare not trust the sweetest frame,
But wholly lean on Jesus’ name.

CHORUS
On Christ, the solid rock, I stand;
All other ground is sinking sand,
All other ground is sinking sand.

2.
When darkness seems to veil His face
I rest on His unchanging grace;
In ev’ry high and stormy gale
My anchor holds within the veil

2.
His oath, His covenant, and blood,
Support me in the ‘whelming flood;
When all around my soul gives way
He then is all my hope and stay.

1.
When He shall come with trumpet sound,
Oh, may I then in Him be found;
Dressed in His righteousness alone,
Faultless to stand before the throne.

- Edward Mote
