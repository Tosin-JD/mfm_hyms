Ring the bell, Watchman

1. 
Come, join our Army, to battle we go;
Jesus will help us to conquer the foe,
Fighting for right and opposing the wrong;
The Salvation Army is marching along.

CHORUS
Marching along, marching along,
The Salvation Army is marching along:
Soldiers of Jesus, be valiant and strong;
The Salvation Army is marching along;

2. 
Come, join our Army, the foe must be driven;
To Jesus, our Captain, the world shall be given;
Foes may surround us,
we’ll press through the throng;
The Salvation Army is marching along.

3. 
Come, join our Army, the foe we defy,
True to our Colours, we’ll fight till we die;
'Saved from all sin’ is our war cry and song;
The Salvation Army is marching along.

4. 
Come, join our Army, and do not delay,
The time for enlisting is passing away;
Fierce is the battle, but victory will come;
The Salvation Army is marching along.
