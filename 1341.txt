If Jesus Goes with Me

1.
It may be in the valley, where countless dangers hide;
It may be in the sunshine, that I in peace abide;.
But this one thing I know if it be dark or fair,
If Jesus is with me, I’ll go anywhere!

CHORUS
If Jesus goes with me, I'll go anywhere!
'Tis heaven to me, Where’er I may be,
If He is there! I count it a privilege here
His cross to bear; If Jesus goes with me,
I'll go anywhere.

2.
It may be I must carry the blessed word of life
Across the burning deserts to those in sinful strife;
And though-it be my lot to bear my colours there,
If Jesus goes with me, I’ll go anywhere!

3.
But if it be my portion to bear my cross at home,
While others bear their burdens
beyond the billow’s foam,
I’ll prove my faith in Him confessHi§ judgments fair,
And if He Stays with me, I’ll stay anywhere!

4.
It is not mine to question the judgments of my Lord,
It is but mine to follow the leadings of His Word;
But if I go or stay, or whether here or there,
I’ll be with my Saviour, content anywhere!
