Jesus Came To Save

1.
Jesus came from heav'n above,
Sinners to save with His own blood;
Gave His life upon the cross,
Suffered there in agony for the lost!

CHORUS
Yes, Jesus came to save the lost;
Came to save us with His blood on the cross,
O, sinner friend, no longer roam;
March with us a happy band to our home.

2.
How could Jesus love me so
That he should save me from such woe?
He In heav’n and earth now reigns!
I shall serve Him while on earth I
remain.

3.
Sinner now obey His call;
Jesus will save you from the fall
In this life you’ll happy be
And in heaven His glories rare you shall see.
