Evington - L. M.

1.
Spirit of mercy, truth, and love,
Oh shed Thine influence from
above
And still from age to age convey
The wonders of this sacred day.

2.
In every clime, by every tongue,
Be God's surpassing glory sung:
Let all the listening earth be taught
The acts our great Redeemer
wrought.

3.
Unfailing Comfort, heavenly Guide,
Still o'er Thy holy Church preside;
Still let mankind Thy blessings prove;
Spirit of mercy, truth, and love.

- Henry Hiles
