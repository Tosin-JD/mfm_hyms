I’ll Live On

1.
'Tis a sweet and glorious tho't that comes to me,
I’ll live on, yes, I’ll live on;
Jesus saved my soul from death and now I’m free,
I’ll live on, yes, I’ll live on.

CHORUS
I’ll live on, yes, I'll live on,
Thru eternity I’ll live on,
I’ll live on, yes, I'll live on,
Thru eternity I’ll live on.

2.
When my body’s lying in the cold, cold clay,
I'll live on, yes, I’ll live on;
I will meet my Jesus in the judgement day,
I'll live on, yes, I’ll live on.

3.
When the world'6 on fire and darkness veils the sun,
I'll live on, yes, I’ll live on;.
Men will cry and to the rocks and mountains run.
I'll live on, yes, I’ll live on.

4.
In the glory land, with God upon the throne,
I'll live on, yes, I'll live on;
Thru eternal ages singing, home, sweet home,
I’ll live on, yes, I’ll live on.
