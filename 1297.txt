Hawkhurst - 8.8.8.8.(L. M.)

1.
See, Christ was wounded for our sake,
and bruised and beaten for our sin,
so by his sufferings we are healed,
for God has laid our guilt on him.

2.
Look on his face, come close to him
see, you will find no beauty there:
despised, rejected, who can tell
the grief and sorrow he must bear?

3.
Like sheep that stray we leave God’spath,
to choose our own and not his will;
like sheep to slaughter he has gone,
obedient to his Father’s will.

4.
Cast out to die by those he loved,
reviled by those he died to save,
see how sin’s pride has sought his death,
see how sin’s hate has made his grave.

5.
For on his shoulders God has laid
the weight of sin that we should bear;
so by his passion we have peace,
through his obedience and his prayer.
