Take Me, O my father - B.7.8.7.

1.
Take me, O my Father, take me!
Take me, save me, thro' Thy Son; .
That which Thou wouldest have me, make me,
Let Thy will in me be done.
Long from Thee my footsteps straying,
Thorny proved the way I trod;
Weary come I now, and praying,
Take me to Thy love, my God!

2.
Fruitless years with grief recalling,
Humbly I confess my sin;
At Thy feet, O Father, falling,
To Thy household take me in.
Freely now to Thee I proffer
This repenting heart of mine;
Freely life and soul I offer,
Gift unworthy of love like Thine.


3.
Once the worldâ€™s Redeemer or dying
Bare our sins upon the tree;
On what Sacrifice relying,
Now I look in hope to Thee:
Father, take me I all forgiving,
Fold me to Thy loving breast;
In Thy for ever living,
I must be for ever blest!

- Ray Palmer, D. D.
