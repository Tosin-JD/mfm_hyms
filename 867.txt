Lubeck - T.7.7.7.

1.
Look to Jesus, and be saved.
See Him hanging on the tree;
Guilty art thou and enslaved.
But He bears thy guilt for thee.

2.
Look, till thou canst see thy sin
In His body crucified;
All the lusts that lurked within,
All thy wilfulness and pride.

3.
Look, and see the judgement fall
On that fault-less guilt-bowed head;
He is made our sin: for ail
One hath died, and all are dead.

4.
Look to Jesus, Look and live,
He has died thy death for thee,
Look, and trust, and love, and give
All thou art His prize to be.

5.
Look with awe, till wondering love
Melts thy heart and dims thine eyes,
And, with prostrate saints above.
Rapt in praise thy spirit lies.
