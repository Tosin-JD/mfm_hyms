St. Stephen - C.M.

1.
The golden gates are lifted up,
The doors are opened wide,
The King of Glory is gone in
Unto His Father’s side.

2.
Thou art gone up before us, Lord,
To make for us a place,
That we may be where now Thou art,
And look upon God’s face.

3.
And ever on our earthly path
A gleam of glory lies,
A light still breaks behind the cloud
That veiled Thee from our eyes.

4.
Lift up our hearts, lift up our minds;
Let Thy dear grace be given,
That while we wander here below,
Our treasure be in heaven;

5.
That where Thou art, at God’s right
Our hope, our love, may be:
Dwell Thou in us, that we may dwell
For evermore in Thee!.

- Mrs C. F. Alexander
