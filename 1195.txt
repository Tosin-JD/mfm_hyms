Bread of Heaven - 7.7.7.7.7.7.

1.
Bread of heaven, on you we feed,
for your flesh is food indeed;
always may our souls be fed
with this true and living bread,
day by day our strength supplied
through your life, O Christ, who died.

2.
Vine of heaven, your precious blood
seals today our peace with God;
Lord, your wounds our healing give,
to your cross we look and live:
Jesus, with your power renew
those who live by faith in you!


- J. Conder
