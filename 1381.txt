We’ve a Story to Tell

1.
We've a story to tell to the nations
That shall turn their hearts to the right,
A story of truth and mercy,
A story of peace and light.

CHORUS
For the darkness shall turn to dawning.
And the dawning to noonday bright.
And Christ's great kingdom shall come to earth.
The kingdom of love and light.

2.
We've a song to be sung to the nations
That shall lift their hearts to the Lord,
A song that shall conquer evil
And shatter the spear and sword.

3.
We’ve a message to give to the nations
That the Lord who reigneth above
Hath sent us His Son to save us
And show us that God is love,

4.
We've a Savour to show to the
nationsWho the path of sorrow hath trod,
That all of the world’s great peoples
Might come to the truth of God.
