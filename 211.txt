Gloria - 7.7.7.7. With Refrain

1.
Angels we have heard on high,
Sweetly singing o’er the plains.
And the mountains in reply
Echo back their joyous strains.

CHORUS
Gloria in excelsis Deo
Gloria in excelsis Deo

2.
Shepherds, why this jubilee?
Why your joyous strains prolong?
Say what may the tidings be,
Which inspire your heav’nly song?

3.
Come to Bethlehem, and see
Him whose birth the angels sing;
Come, adore on bended knee
Christ the Lord, the new born King.

4.
See within a manger laid
Jesus, Lord of heav’n and earth!
Mary, Joseph, lend your aid.
With us sing our Saviour’s birth.
