St. Mary - C.M.

1.
Weep not for Him who onward bears
His Cross to Calvary;
He does not ask manâ€™s pitying tears,
Who wills for man to die.

2.
The awful sorrow of His face.
The bowing of His frame,
Come not from torture nor disgrace:
He fears not Cross nor shame.

3.
There is a deeper pang of grief,
An agony unknown,
In which His love finds no relief
He bears it all alone.

4.
He sees the souls for whom He dies
Yet clinging to their sin,
And heirs of mansions in the skies
Who will not enter in.

5.
O may I in Thy sorrow share,
And mourn that sins of mine
Should ever wound with grief or care
That loving heart of Thine.
