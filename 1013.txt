AFTER THE SUNRISE

1.
Sorrows surround us while treading life’s road,
Troubles confound us, make heavy our load;
Fetters that bound us, no longer will goad
After the sunrise, how happy we’ll be

CHORUS
(After the sunrise),happy we’ll be,
(We know after the sunrise,) Jesus we’ll see;
All will be glory, singing the story.
After the sunrise, how happy we’ll be.

2.
Shadows will vanish when morning shall come,
Love light will banish sin’s vapors like scum;
Even the clannish together will
hum,After the sunrise, how happy we’ll be.

3.
Angels are waiting to carry the news,
Why stand debating, why longer refuse?
Cease all your hateing, be changing your views.
After the surise, how happy we’ll be.
