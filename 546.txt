1.
Come, Thou everlasting Spirit,
Bring to ev’ry thankful mind,
All the Saviour’s dying merit,
All His suff'rings for mankind:
True Recorder of His passion,
Now the living faith impart;
Now reveal His great salvation
Unto ev'ry faithful heart.

2.
Come, Thou witness of His dying;
Come, Remembrancer divine;
Let us feel Thy power applying
Christ to every soul, and mine,
Yes, in me, in me He dwelleth;
I in Him, and He in me!
And my empty soul He filleth,
Here and through eternity.

- C. Wesley
