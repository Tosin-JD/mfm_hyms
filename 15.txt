Harewood - 6.6.6.6.4.4.4.4.

1.
Christ is our corner-stone,
On him alone we build;
With his true saints alone
The courts of heaven are filled;
On his great love
Our hopes we place
Of present grace
And joys above.

2.
O then with hymns of praise
These hallowed courts shall ring;
Our voices we will raise
The Three in One to sing;
And thus proclaimIn joyful song,
Both loud and long,
That glorious name.

3.
Here, gracious God, do thou
For evermore draw nigh;
Accept each faithful vow,
And mark each suppliant sigh;
In copious shower
On all who pray
Each holy day
Thy blessings pour.

4.
Here may we gain from heaven
The grace which we implore;
And may that grace, once given,
Be with us evermore;
Until that day
When all the blest
To endless rest
Are called away.

- Tr. John Chandler
