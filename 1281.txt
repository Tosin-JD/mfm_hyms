Battle Hymn 15.15.15.6 with Refrain

1.
Mine eyes have seen the glory of
the coming of the Lord,
He is trampling out the vintage
where the grapes of wrath are stored;
He hath loosed the fateful lightning
of His terrible swift sword;
His truth is marching on.

CHORUS
Glory! glory, halleluja!
Glory! glory, hallelujah!
Glory! glory, hallelujah!
His truth is marching on.

2.
I have seen Him in the watch-fires
of a hundred circling camps,
The have builded Him an altar in the
evening dews and damps;
I can read His righteous sentence
by the dim and flaring lamps
His day is marching on.

3.
He has sounded forth the trumpet
that shall never sound retreat,
He is sifting out the hearts of men
before His judgement seat;
O be swift, my soul, to answer Him!
be jubilant, my feet!
Our God is marching on.

4.
In the beauty of the lilies Christ was
born across the sea.
With a glory in His bosom that
transfigures you and me;
As He died to make men holy, let us
live to make men free,
While God is marching on.

- Julia Ward Howe
