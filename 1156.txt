Bremen - 7.6.7.6.

1.
God is my strong salvation;
What foe have I to fear?
In darkness and temptation
My light, my help is near.

2.
Though hosts encamp around me,
Firm to the fight I stand;
What terror can confound me,
With God at my right hand?

3.
Place on the Lord reliance;
My soul, with courage wait;
His truth be thine affiance,
When faint and desolate.

4.
His might thine heart shall strong then,
His love thy joy increase;
Mercy thy days shall lengthen;
The Lord will give thee peace.

- James Montgomery
