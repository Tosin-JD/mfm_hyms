The Nail Scarred Hand

1.
Have you failed in your plan of your storm tossed life?
Place your hand in the nail scarred hand;
Are you weary and worn from its toil and strife?
Place your hand in the nail scarred hand.

CHORUS
Place your hand in the nail scarred hand.
Place your hand in the nail scarred hand;
He will keep to the end,
Heâ€™s your dearest friend,
Place your hand in the nail scarred hand.

2.
Are you walking alone through the shadows dim?
Place your hand in the nail scarred hand:
Christ will comfort your heart, put your trust in Him,
Place your hand in the nail scarred hand.

3.
Would you follow the will of the risen Lord?
Place your hand in the nail scarred hand;
Would you live in the light of His blessed Word?
Place your hand in the nail scarred hand.

4.
Is your soul burdened down with its load of sin?
Place you hand in the nail scarred hand;
Throw your heart open wide, let the Saviour in,
Place your hand in the nail scarred hand.
