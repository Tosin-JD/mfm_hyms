263
Look, and thou shalt live

1.
Look to the Saviour on Calvary’s tree
See how He suffer’d for you and me;
Hark, while He lovingly calls to thee,
“Look, and thou shalt live!”

CHORUS
Look, and thou shalt live!
Look, and thou shalt live!
Look to the cross where He died for thee:
Look, and thou shalt live!

2.
Hast thou a sin burden’d soul to save?
Life everlasting wouldst thou have?
Jesus Himself a ransom gave;
Look, and thou shalt live!

3.
Look to the Saviour who rose from the tomb;
Haste now to Him, while there yet is room;
His shining face will dispel thy gloom:
Look, and thou shalt live!

4.
Jesus on high lives to intercede.
He knows the weary sinner’s need;
Surely thy footsteps he will lead:
Look, and thou shalt live!

- F.T.W.
