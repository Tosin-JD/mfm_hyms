1.
Take Thou our minds, dear Lord, we humbly pray;
Give us the mind of Christ each passing day;
Teach us to know the truth that sets us free;
Grant us in all our thoughts to honour Thee.

2.
Take Thou our hearts, O Christ, they are Thine own;
Come Thou within our souls and claim Thy throne;
Help us to shed abroad Thy deathless love;
Use us to make the earth like heaven above.

3.
Take Thou our wills, Most High!
Hold Thou full sway;
Have in our inmost souls Thy perfect way;
Guard Thou each sacred hour from selfish ease;
Guide Thou our ordered lives as Thou dost please.

4.
Take Thou ourselves, O Lord, heart, mind, and will;
Through surrendered souls Thy plans fulfil.
We yield ourselves to Thee time, talents, all;
We hear, and henceforth heed, Thy sovereign call.

- William H. Foulkes
