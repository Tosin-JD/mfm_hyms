Rejoice, Ye Saints, The Time Draws Near

1 Rejoice, ye saints, the time draws near
When Christ will in the cloud appear,
And for His people call.

CHORUS
Trim your lamps and be ready.
Trim your lamps and be ready,
Trim your lamps, and be ready
for the midnight cry.
For the midnight cry,
for the midnight cry
trim your lamps and be ready for the midnight cry.

2.
The Trumpet sounds, the thunder roll;
The heavens passing as a scroll,
The earth will burn with fire.

3.
Poor sinners then on earth will cry.
While lightnings flash from the sky,
“O mountains, on us fall!”

4.
Come, brethren all, and let us try
To warn poor sinner, and to cry,
“Behold, the Bridegroom come!”.
