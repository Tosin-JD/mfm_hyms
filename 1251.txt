North Coates -6.5.6.5.

1.
Jesus, high in glory.
Lend a list’ning ear,
When we bow before Thee,
Children’s praises hear.

2.
Tho' Thou art so holy,
Heav’ns almighty King,
Thou wilt stoop to listen
While Thy praise we sing.

3.
We are little children,
Weak and apt to stray:
Saviour, guide and keep us
In the heavenly way.

4.
Save us, Lord, from sinning.
Watch us day by day:
Help us now to love Thee,
Take our sins away.

5.
Then when Thou shalt call us
To our heavenly home,
We will gladly answer,
“Saviour, Lord, we come.”

6.
In the many mansions,
From all sin set free,
Loud shall be our praises,
When Thy face we see.
