1104
Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus

1.
O soul, are you weary and troubled?
No light in the darkness you see?
There’s light for a look at the Saviour,
And life more abundant and free!

CHORUS
Turn your eyes upon Jesus.
Look full in His wonderful face;
And the things of earth will grow strangely dim
In the light of His glory and grace.

2.
Through death into life everlasting
He passed, and we follow Him there;
Over us sin no more hath dominion,
For more than conqu’rors we are!

3.
His word shall not fail you He promised;
Believe Him and all will be well:
Then go to a world that is dying,
His perfect salvation to tell!
