Dare to Be a Daniel

1.
Standing by a purpose true,
Heeding God's command,
Honour them, the faithful few!
All hail to Daniel’s Band!

CHORUS
Dare to be a Daniel,
Dare to stand alone,
Dare to have a purpose firm!
Dare to make it known!

2.
Many mighty men are lost,
Daring not to stand,
Who for God had been a host.
By joining Daniel s Band!

3.
Many giants, great and tall.
Stalking through the land,
Head long to the earth would fall.
If met by Daniel's Band!

4.
Hold the Gospel banner high!
On the victory grand!
Satan and his host defy,
And shout for Daniel's Band!
