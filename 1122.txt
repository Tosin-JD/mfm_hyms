Why Should I Charge My Soul With Care

1.
Why should I charge my soul with care?
The wealth in every mine
Belongs to Christ, God’s Son and Heir,
And He’s a Friend of mine.

CHORUS
Yes, He’s a Friend of mine,
And He with me doth all things share;
Since all is Christ’s and Christ is mine,
Why should I have a care?
For Jesus is a Friend of mine.

2.
The silver moon, the golden sun,
And all the stars that shine,
Are His alone, yes, every one,
And He’s a Friend of mine.

3.
He daily spread a glorious feast,
And at His table dine,
The whole creation, man and beast,
And He’s a Friend of mine.

4.
And when He comes in bright array,
And leads the conquering line,
It will be glory then to say,
That He’s a Friend of mine.
