Tell the Good News

1.
Christ was born in a distant land,
Tell the good news, tell the good news;
Lived on earth for the good of man,
Tell the good news, tell the good news.

CHORUS
Tell the good news, tell the good news,
Tell the good news Christ has come;
Tell the good news, tell the good news,
Tell the good news to ev’ry one.

2.
Christ became a man on earth,
Tell the good news, tell the good
news,
Gave his life for man’s re-birth.
Tell the good news, tell the good
news,

3.
Christ arose and to heaven went,
Tell the good news, tell the good news,
All may follow who repent,
Tell the good news, tell the good news,

4.
Christ still lives in the world today,
Tell the good news, tell the good news.
Giving strength to all souls who pray,
Tell the good news tell the good news,
