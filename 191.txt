Corde natus ex parentis - 8.7.8.7.87.7.

1.
Of the Father’s love begotten,
Ere the worlds began to be,
He, the Alpha and Omega,
he the source, the ending
He Of the things that are, that have been.
And that future years shall see.
Evermore and evermore.

2.
He is here, whom seers afore time
Chanted while the ages ran;
Whom the faithful word of prophets
Promised since the world began;
Long foretold, at length appearing.
Praise Him every child of man,
Evermore and evermore.

3.
Blessed was the day for ever,
When by God the Spirit’s grace
From the womb of virgin mother
Came the Saviour of our race,
When the child, the world’s
Redeemer,
First displayed His sacred face.
Evermore and evermore.

4.
Praise Him, O ye heaven of heavens;
Praise Him, angels in the height;
All dominions bow before him,
And exalt His wondrous might;
Let no tongue of man be silent;
Let each voice and heart unite,
Evermore and evermore.

5.
Christ, to Thee, with God the Father,
And, O Holy Ghost, to Thee,
Hymn and chant and high thanks giving,
And unwearied praises be,
Honour, glory and dominion,
And eternal victory,
Evermore and evermore.

- Aurelius C. Prudentius
