1426
Beulah Land

1.
I’ve reached the land of corn and wine,
And all its riches freely mine;
Here shines undimmed one blissful day,
For all my night has passed away.

CHORUS
0 Beulah land, sweet Beulah land,
As on thy highest mount I stand,
I look away across the sea,
Where mansions are prepared for me,
And view the shining glory shore.
My Heav’n, my home forever more!

2
My Saviour comes and walks with me,
And sweet communion here have we;
He gently leads me by His hand,
For this is Heaven’s borderland.

3.
A sweet perfume upon the breeze
Is borne from ever vernal trees,
And flow’rs, that never fading grow,
Where streams of life forever flow.

3.
The zephyrs seem to float to me,
Sweet sounds of Heaven’s melody,
As angels with the white robed throng
Join in the sweet Redemption song.
