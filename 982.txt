Keep on believing

1.
When you feel weakest, dangers surround,
Subtle temptation, troubles abound,
Nothing seems hopeful, nothingseems glad,
All is despairing, even time sad:

CHORUS
Keep on believing, Jesus is near.
Keep on believing, there s nothing to fear!
Keep on believing, this is the way;
Faith in the night as well as the day.

2.
If all were easy, if all were bright,
Where would the cross be? And where the fight?
But in the hardness, God gives to you
Chances of proving that you are true.

3.
God is your Wisdom, God is your Might,
God’s ever near you, guiding you right;
He understands you, knows all you need.
Trusting in Him you’ll surely
succeed.

4.
Let us press on then, never despair,
Live above feeling, victory’s there;
Jesus can keep us so near to Him
That nevermore our faith shall grow dim.
