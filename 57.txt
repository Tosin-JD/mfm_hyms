Harwell - 8.7.8.7.7.7. with Alleluias

1.
Hark, ten thousand harps and voices
Sound the note of praise above;
Jesus reigns and heaven rejoices,
Jesus reigns, the God of love;
See, He sits on yonder throne,
Jesus rules the world alone;
Alleluia! alleluia! alleluia! amen

2.
Jesus, hail! whose glory brightens
All above, and gives it worth;
Lord of life, Thy smile enlightens,
Cheers and charms Thy saints onearth;
When we think of love like Thine,
Lord, we own it love divine:
Alleluia! alleluia! alleluia! amen

3.
King of glory, reign for ever;
Thine an everlasting crown:
Nothing from Thy love shall sever
Those whom Thou hast made Thine
own;
Happy objects of Thy grace,
Destined to behold Thy face,
Alleluia! alleluia! alleluia! amen

4.
Saviour, hasten Thine appearing;
Bring, O bring the glorious day,
When, the awful summons hearing,
Heaven and earth shall pass away;
Then with golden harps we’ll sing,
“Glory, glory to our King!”
Alleluia! alleluia! alleluia! amen
