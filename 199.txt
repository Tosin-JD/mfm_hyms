In excelsis gloria - Irregular

1.
When Christ was born of Mary free,
In Bethlehem that fair city,
Angels sang there with mirth and glee,

CHORUS
‘In excelsis gloria, In excelsis gloria,
In excelsis gloria, In excelsis gloria,
In excelsis gloria, In excelsis gloria.’

2.
Herdsmen beheld these angels bright,
To them appearing with great light,
Who said ‘God's Son is born to night:’

3.
The King is come to save mankind,
As in scripture truths we find,
Therefore this song we have in mind;

4.
Then, dear Lord, for Thy great grace,
Grant us in bliss to see Thy face,
That we may sing to Thy solace;
