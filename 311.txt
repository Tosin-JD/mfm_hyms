Rawlins -7.7.7.5.D.

1.
I will go, I cannot stay
From the arms of love away;
O for strength of faith to say,
Jesus died for me,

CHORUS
Can it be, O can it be,
There is hope for one like me?
I will go with this my plea,
Jesus died for me.

2.
Tho’ I long have tried in vain,
Tried to break the tempter’s chain,
Yet today I’ll try again,
Jesus, help Thou me.

3.
I am lost, and yet I know
Earth can never heal my woe;
I will rise at once and go,
Jesus died for me.

4.
Something whispers in my soul,
Tho’ my sins like mountains roll,
Jesus’ blood will make me whole,
Jesus died for me.

- Martha J. Lankton
