St. Agnes

1.
Jesus, the very thought of Thee
With sweetness fills my breast;
But sweeter far Thy face to see,
And in Thy presence rest.

2.
No voice can sing, no heart can frame,
Nor can the memory find
A sweeter sound than Thy blest name
O Saviour of mankind!

3.
O Hope of evâ€™ry contrite heart,
O Joy of all the meek,
To those who ask, how kind Thou art!
How good to those who seek!

4.
But what to those who find? Ah! this
Nor tongue nor pen can show,
The love of Jesus, what it is
None but His loved ones know.

- Attr. to Bernard of Clairvaux
