812
Jesus is Best of All
1 My happy heart is singing
My heav'nly Father’s love,
He sends so many blessings
Like sunbeams from above.

CHORUS
But Jesus is the best of all,
Yes, Jesus is the best of all,
Of all the joys that may surround me,
The best of all is Jesus.

2.
Tho other joys may fail me,
And sorrows may befall,
My saviour will be with me,
And he is best of all.

3.
O let me tell to others
The story of his grace,
Rejoicing in his service
Until i see his face.

4.
And when I view the glories
Within the jasper wall,
I’ll sing, with all the ransomed,
My Saviour’s best of all.
