The unveiled Christ - 8.7.8.7. with Refrain

1.
Once our blessed Christ of beauty
Was veiled off from human view;
But thro' suffering, death and sorrow
He has rent the veil in two.

CHORUS
O behold the-Man of Sorrows,
O behold Him in plain view;
Lo! He is the mighty conqueror.
Since He rent the veil in two.
Lo! He is the mighty conqueror.,
Since He rent the veil in two.

2.
Now He is with God the Father,
Interceding there for you;
For He is the mighty conqueror.
Since He rent the veil in two.

4.
Throâ€™-out time and endless ages,
Heights and depths of love so true;
He alone can be the giver
Since He rent the veil in two.

5.
Holy angels bow before Him,
Men of earth give praises due;
For He is the well beloved
Since He rent the veil in two.
