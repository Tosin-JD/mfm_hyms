Ellesdie-8.7.8.7.D.

1.
Jesus, I my cross have taken.
All to leave and follow Thee;
Destitute, despised, forsaken,
Thou from hence my all shalt be:
Perish every fond ambition,
All I've sought, and hoped and known;
Yet how rich is my condition,
God and heav'n are still my own!

2.
Let the world despise and leave me,
They have left my Saviour too;
Human hearts and looks deceive me;
Thou art not, like man, untrue;
And, while Thou shalt smile upon me,
God of wisdom, love, and might,
Foes may hate and friends may
shun me;Show Thy face, and all is bright.

3.
Man may trouble and distress me.
“Twill but drive me to Thy breast;
Life with trials hard may press me,
Heav’n will bring me sweeter rest.
O ‘tis not in grief to harm me,
While Thy love is left to me;
O 'twere not in joy to charm me,
Were that joy unmixed with Thee

4.
Hasten on from grace to glory,
Armed by faith and winged by prayer;
Heav’n’s eternal days before me,
God’s own hand shall guide me there.
Soon shall close my earthly mission,
Swift shall pass my pilgrim days,
Hope shall change to glad fruition,
Faith to sight, and prayer to praise.

- Henry F. Lyte
