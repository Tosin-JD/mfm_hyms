Illsley - L. M.

1.
O Father, by whose sovereign sway
The sun and stars in order move.
Yet who hast made us bold to say
Thy nature and thy name is love:

2.
O royal Son, whose every deed
Showed love and love’s divinity.
Yet didst not scorn the humblest need
At Cana’s feast in Galilee:

3.
O Holy Spirit, who dost speak
In saint and sage since time began.
Yet givest courage to the weak
And teachest love to selfish man:

4.
Be present in our hearts today,
All powerful to bless, and giv
To these thy children grace that they
May love, and through their loving live.

- Cyril Argentine Alington
