661
I’ve Anchored In Jesus

1.
Upon life’s boundless ocean where mighty billows roll,
I've fixed my hope in Jesus, blest anchor of my soul;
When trials fierce assail me as storms are gathering o’er,
I rest upon His mercy and trust Him more

CHORUS
I’ve anchored in Jesus, the storms of life I'll brave,
I’ve anchor’d in Jesus, I fear no wind or wave.
I’ve anchored in Jesus for He hath pow’r to save.
I’ve anchored to the Rock of Ages.

2.
He keeps my soul from evil and gives me blessed peace,
His voice hath stilled the waters and bid their tumult cease;
My Pilot and Deliverer, to Him I all confide,
For always when I need Him, He’s at my side.

3.
He is my Friend and Saviour, in Him my anchor’s cast,
He drives away my sorrows and shields me from the blast;
By faith I'm looking upward beyond life’s troubled sea,
There I behold a haven prepared for me.
