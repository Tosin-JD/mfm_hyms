1.
O Solider of Jesus, how blessed art thou,
For Jesus is waiting to strengthen thee now,
Fear not to rely on the word of thy God,
Step out on the promise Get washed in the Blood;
Step out on the promise Getwashed in the Blood

2.
Oh, ye that are hungry and thirsty, rejoice,
For ye shall be filled; oh, hear that sweet voice
Inviting you now to the banquet of God;
Step out on the promise get
washed in the Blood.

3.
Who sighs for a heart iniquity free?
O poor, troubled soul, there’s a promise for thee!
There’s rest, weary one, in the bosom of God:
Step out on the promise get
Washed in the Blood.

4.
The promise can’t save, though
each promise is true;
‘Tis the Blood of the Lamb that does
cleanse us right through;
It cleanses us now, oh, glory to God!
We rest on the promise we’re
Washed in the Blood.
