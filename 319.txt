The Mistakes of my Life

1.
The mistakes of my life have been many.
The sins of my heart have been more,
And I scarce can see for weeping,
But I’ll knock at the open door.

CHORUS
I know I am weak and sinful,
It comes to me more and more;
But when the dear Saviour shall bid me come in,
I’ll enter the open door.

2.
I am lowest of those who love Him,
I am weakest of those who pray;
But I come as He has bidden,
And He will not say me nay.

3.
My mistakes His free grace will cover,
My sins He will wash away;
And the feet that shrink and falter
Shall walk through the gates of day.

4.
The mistakes of my life have beenmany,
And my spirit is sick with sin,
And I scarce can see for weeping,
But the Saviour will let me in.
