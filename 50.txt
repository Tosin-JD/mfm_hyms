1.
Let us, with a gladsome mind,
Praise the Lord, for he is kind:
For his mercies ay endure,
Ever faithful, ever sure.

2.
Let us blaze his name abroad,
For of gods he is the God:
For his mercies ay endure,
Ever faithful, ever sure.

3.
He with all commanding might
Filled the new made world with light:
For his mercies ay endure,
Ever faithful, ever sure.

4.
He the golden tressed sun
Caused all day his course to run:
For his mercies ay endure,
Ever faithful, ever sure.

5.
And the horned moon at night
'Mid her spangled sisters bright:
For his mercies ay endure,
Ever faithful, ever sure.

6.
All things living he doth feed,
His full hand supplies their need:
For his mercies ay endure,
Ever faithful, ever sure.

7.
Let us, with a gladsome mind,
Praise the Lord, for he is kind:
For his mercies ay endure,
Ever faithful, ever sure.

- John Milton
