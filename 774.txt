O grant us light - L.M.

1.
O. grant us light, that we may know
The wisdom Thou alone canst give;
That truth may guide where’er we go,
And virtue bless where'er we live!

2.
O grant us light, that we may see
Where error lurks in human lore,
And turn our doubting minds to Thee,
And love Thy simple word the more.

3.
O grant us light, that we may see
How dead is life from Thee apart;
How sure is joy for all who turn
To Thee an undivided heart.

4.
O grant us light, in grief and pain,
To lift our burdened hearts above,
And count the very cross as gain,
And bless our Father’s hidden love.

5.
O grant us light, when, soon or late,
All earthly scenes shall pass away,
In Thee to find the open gate
To deathless home and endless day.
