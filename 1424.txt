Hilltops of Glory

1.
Onward rejoicng I tread life's way.
Higher I’m climbing each passing day;
Hilltops of glory now rise in view,
where all shall be made new.

CHORUS
Hilltops of glory I now can see
O brother won’t you come go with me?
Safe on the mountain I soon
shall Hilltops of glory land.

2.
Way down in Egypt mid burning,
Moses had started for Canaan’s land;
Never turn backward always ascend
on to the journey’s end.

3.
Footsteps of Jesus before us lead,
We tread life’s journey His warnings heed;
Evil allurements cannot prevail,
I’m on the upward trail.
