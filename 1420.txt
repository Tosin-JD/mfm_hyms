All Saints-8.7.8.7.7.7.

1.
Who are these like stars appearing,
These, before God’s throne who stand?
Each a golden crown is wearing,
Who are all this glorious hand?
Hallelujah! hark, they sing,
Praising loud their heavenly King.

2.
Who are these in dazzling brightness,
Clothed in God’s own righteousness:
These, whose robes of purest whiteness
Shall their lustre still possess,
Still untouch’d by time’s rude hand?
Whence come all this glorious band?

3.
These are they who have contended
For their Saviour’s honour long,
Wrestling on till life was ended.
Following not the sinful throng;
These, who well the fight sustain’d,
Triumph by the Lamb have gain’d.

4.
These are they whose hearts were riven,
Sore with woe and anguish tried,
Who in prayer full oft have striven
With the God they glorified;
Now, their painful conflict o’er,
God has bid them weep no more.

5.
These are they who watch’d and waited
Offering up to Christ their will,
Soul and body consecrated.
Day and night to serve Him still;
Now in God’s most holy place
Blest they stand before His face.
