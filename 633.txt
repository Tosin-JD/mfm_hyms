The Lord Is Coming The World Will Quake - L.M.
1 The Lord is coming the world will quake,
And every mountain shall be moved;
And all the stars of heaven too,
Shall cease to shine nor give their light.

2.
The Lord is coming unlike before.
When He came in humility ;
When He was slain as Lamb of God,
Our suffering Saviour who has died.

3.
The Lord is coming, doth come in fear,
In flaming fire and in great wrath;
Coming, on cherub wings doth fly,
Coming the Great Judge of the earth.

3.
Is this the one who walked on earth,
Just like a pilgrim on life’s road
Was persecuted and oppressed,
Is this the one, He that was slain.

4.
The wicked hid themselves in vain,
Hid in the rocks and in the dens;
But faith that has the victory.
Shall sing at last, The Lord has come.”
