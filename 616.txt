MY LORD HAS GARMENT SO WONDROUS FINE

1.
My Lord has garments so wondrous fine.
And myrrh their texture fills;
Its fragrance reached to this heart of mine,
With joy my being thrills.

CHORUS
Out of the ivory palaces,
Into a world of woe,
Only His great, eternal love
Made my Saviour go.

2.
His life had also its sorrows sore,
For aloes had a part;
And when I think of the cross He bore,
My eyes with tear-drops start.

3.
His garments too were in cassia dipped,
With healing in a touch;
Each time my feet in some sin have slipped,
He took me from its clutch.

4.
In garments glorious He will come,
To open wide the door;
And I shall enter my heav’nly home,
To dwell for ever more.

- Henry Barraclough
