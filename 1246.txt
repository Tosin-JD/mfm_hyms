1246
If I Come To Jesus

1.
If I come to Jesus,
He will make me glad;
He will give me pleasure
When my heart is sad.

CHORUS
If I come to Jesus,
Happy I shall be,
He is gently calling
Little ones like me.

2.
If I come to Jesus.
He will hear my prayâ€™r;
For He loves me dearly,
And my sins did bear.

3.
If I come to Jesus,
He will take my hand;
He will kindly lead me
To a better land.

3.
There with happy children,
Robed in snowy white,
I shall see my Saviour,
In that world so bright.

- Fanny J. Crosby
