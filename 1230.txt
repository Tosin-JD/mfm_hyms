Let It ring

1.
I’ll praise the Lord in my house,
Will you praise the Lord in yours?
If we praise the Lord in this state,
Soon this whole great country will know that
Jesus Christ our Saviour has
conquered ev’ry foe.

CHORUS
It’s ringing here, it’s ringing there,
The joy of the Lord is ev'rywhere.
It’s ringing loud, It’s ringing clear,
The joy of the Lord is here!

2.
I’ll thank the Lord in my house.
Will you thank the Lord in yours?
If we thank the Lord in our town,
Will you thank the Lord in yours?
If we thank the Lord in this state.
Soon this whole great country will know that
Jesus Christ our Saviour has
conquered ev’ry foe.

3.
I’ll serve the Lord in my house,
Will you serve the Lord in yours?
If we serve the Lord in our town,
Will you serve the Lord in yours?
If we serve the Lord in this state,
Soon this whole great country will know that
Jesus Christ our Saviour has
conquered ev'ry foe.
