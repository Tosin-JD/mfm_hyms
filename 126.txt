Dretzel - 8.7.8.7.7.7.

1.
Through the day Thy love has spread us;
Now we lay us down to rest;
Through the silent watches guard us,
Let no foe our peace molest:
Jesus, thou our guardian be;
Sweet it is to trust in thee.

2.
Pilgrims here on earth and strangers,
Dwelling in the midst of foes,
Us and ours preserve from dangers;
In thine arms may we repose,
And, when lifeâ€™s sad day is past,
Rest with thee in heaven at last.
