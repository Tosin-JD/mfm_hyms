Hotham-7.7.7.7.D.


1.
Fainting soul, be bold, be strong,
Wait the leisure of thy Lord;
Though it seem to tarry long,
True and faithful is His word:
On His word my soul I cast
He cannot Himself deny;
It shall speak, and shall not lie,

2.
Every one that seeks shall find,
Every one that asks shall have,
Christ, the Saviour of mankind,
Willing able, all to save;
I shall His salvation see,
I in faith on Jesus call,
I from sin shall be set free.
Perfectly set free from all

3.
Lord, my time is in Thine hand;
Weak and helpless as I am,
Surely Thou canst make me stand,
I believe in Jesuâ€™s name:
Saviour in temptation Thou;
Thou hast saved me heretofore,
Thou from sin dost save me now,
Thou shalt save me evermore.

- Charles Wesley
