Now I am Coming Home

1.
Long I have wander’d afar from my Lord,
Now I am coming home;
Longing to be to His favour restor’d,
Now I am coming home.

CHORUS
Yes, I am coming, Dear Lord, I’m coming,
Just now I’m coming home.
Yes, I am coming, Dear Lord, I’m coming,
Just now I’m coming home.

2.
Tired of the world with its folly and sin,
Now I am coming home;
Believing the Saviour will welcome me in,
Now I am coming home.

3.
Knowing my Saviour can give me His rest,
Now I am coming home;
Longing to anchor my soul on His breast,
Now I am coming home.

4.
Humbly I crave but a poor servant’s place,
Now I am coming home.
Only desiring to taste of His grace,
Now I am coming home.

5.
O bless the Lord, my dear Saviour I see,
Now I am coming home;
Waiting to welcome a sinner like me,
Now I am coming home.
