A Soul Winner for Jesus

1.
I want to be a soul winner
For Jesus ev’ry day,
He does so much for me;
I want to aid the lost sinner
To leave his erring Way,
And be from bondage free.

CHORUS
A soul winner for Jesus,
A soul winner for Jesus,
0 let me be each day
A soul winner for Jesus,
A soul winner for Jesus,
He’s done so much for me

2.
I want to be a soul winner
And bring the lost to Christ,
That they His grace may know;
I want to live for Christ forever,
And do His blessed will,
Because He loves me so.

3.
I want to be a soul winner
Till Jesus calls for me,
To lay my burdens down;
I want to hear Him say, "Servant,
you've gathered many sheaves,
Receive a shining crown."
