Tell it, Sing It, Shout It

1.
There’s a blessed story of redeeming love,
How it keeps us thinking of the joys above;
How it lightens sorrow, trouble,grief and care;
Let us tell it, sing it, shout it everywhere.

CHORUS
O tell it o’er and o'er,
Yes tell it more and more,
Till no soul can doubt it, fill the air;
Oh, tell it, sing it, shout it everywhere.

2.
Many long to hear it, for they need its cheer,
Need its light to guide them when the way is drear;
Many need its comfort in the hour of woe;
Tell it. sing it, shout it, as along we go-.

3.
It has blessed the ages with its golden light;
Guided countless pilgrims thro’ the dreary night;
That we may adore Him on His throne above,
Tell and sing and shout the story of His love.
