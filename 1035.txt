CHILDREN OF THE HEAV'NLY KING

1.
Children of the heav'nly King,
As ye journey, sweetly sing;
Sing your Saviour’s worthy praise,
Glorious in his works and ways.

2.
We are trav’ling home to God,
In the way the fathers trod:
They are happy now, and we
Soon Their happiness shall see

3.
Lift your eyes, sons of light,
Sion’s city is in sight;
There Our endless home shall be,
There our Lord we soon shall see.


4.
Fear not, brethren; joyful stand
On the borders of your land;
Jesus Christ, your Father’s Son,
Bids you undismayed go on.

5.
Lord, obedient we go,
Gladly leaving all below;
Only thou our leader be,
And we will still follow thee.

- John Cennick
