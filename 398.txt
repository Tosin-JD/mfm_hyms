Give me Jesus -8.7.8.7. with Refrain

1.
Take the world, but give me Jesus,
All its joys are but a name;
But His love abideth ever,
Thru eternal years the same.

CHORUS
O the height and depth of mercy!
O the length and breadth of love!
O the fullness of redemption,
Pledge of endless life above!

2.
fake the world, but give me Jesus,
Sweetest comfort of my soul;
With my Saviour watching oâ€™er me,
I can sing tho billows roll.

3.
Take the world, but give me Jesus,
Let me view His constant smile;
Then thru out my pilgrim journey
Light will cheer me all the while.

4.
Take the world, but give me Jesus,
In His cross my trust shall be;
Till, with clearer, brighter vision,
Face to face my Lord I see.
