Caersalem - 8.7.8.7.4.7.

1.
Blessed Lord, in Thee is refuge,
Safety for my trembling soul,
Pow’r to lift my head when drooping,
‘Midst the angry billows' roll.
I will trust Thee,
All my life Thou shalt control.

2.
In the past too unbelieving
“Midst the tempest I have been,
And my heart has slowly trusted
What my eyes have never seen.
Blessed Jesus,
Teach me on Thine arm to lean.

3.
Oh, for trust that brings me triumph,
When defeat seems strangely near!
Oh, for faith that changes fighting
Into victory's ringing cheer!
Faith triumphant!
Knowing not defeat or fear.

4.
Faith triumphant blessed vict’ry!
Every barrier swept away!
Heaven descending, joy and fulness,
Dawn of everlasting day!
Jesus only
Him to love and Him obey.
