St. John-6.6.6.6.8.8.

1.
O Thou that hearest prayer!
Attend our humble cry;
And let Thy servants share
Thy blessing from on high:
We plead the promise of Thy Word;
Grant us Thy Holy Spirit, Lord!

2.
If earthly parents hear
Their children when they cry;
if they, with love sincere,
Their children’s wants supply:
Much more wilt Thou Thy love display,
And answer when Thy children pray.

3.
Our heavenly Father Thou;
We children of Thy grace;
Oh, let Thy Spirit now
Descend and fill the place;
That all may feel the heavenly flame,
And all unite to praise Thy name.
