National Hymn -10.10.10.10.

1.
Heralds of Christ, who bear the King’s commands,
Immortal tidings in your mortal hands,
Pass on and carry swift the news ye bring,
Make straight, make straight the
highway of the King.

2.
Thro' desert ways, dark fen and deep morass,
Thro’jungles, sluggish seas, and mountain pass,
Build ye the road, and falter not, nor stay,
Prepare across the earth the King’s highway.

3.
Where once the twisting trail in darkness wound,
Let marching feet and joyous song resound,
Where burn the fun’ral pyres, and censers swing,
Make straight, make straight the
highway of the King.

4.
Lord, give us faith and strength the road to build,
To see the promise of the day fulfilled,
When war shall be no more and strife shall cease
Upon the highway of the Prince ofpeace.

- Laura S. Copenhaver
