HE LEADETH ME

1.
He leadeth me! O blessed thought!
O words with heav’nly comfort fraught!
Whatever I do, wherever I be,
Still ‘tis God's hand that leadeth me.

CHORUS
He leadeth me, He leadeth me,
By His own hand He leadeth me;
His faithful follower I would be,
For by His hand He leadeth me.

2.
Sometimes mid scenes of deepest gloom,
Sometimes where Eden’showers bloom,
By waters still, o'er troubled sea,
Still ‘tis His hand that leadeth me!

3.
Lord, I would clasp Thy hand In mine,
Nor ever murmur nor repine;
Content, whatever lot I see,
Since ‘tis my God that leadeth me!

4.
And when my task on earth is done,
When by Thy grace the vict’ry's won,
E’en death's cold wave I will not flee,
Since God thru Jordan leadeth me.
