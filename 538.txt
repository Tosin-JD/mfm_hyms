Trentham-S.M.

1.
Breathe on me, Breath of God,
Fill me with life a-new,
That I may love what Thou dost love,
And do what Thou wouldst do

2.
Breathe on me, Breath of God.
Until my heart is pure,
Until my will is one with Thine,
To do and to endure.

3.
Breathe on me, Breath of God,
Till I am wholly Thine,
Till all this earthly part of me
Glows with Thy fire divine.

4.
Breathe on me, Breath of God,
So shall I never die,
But live with Thee the
perfect life of Thine eternity.
