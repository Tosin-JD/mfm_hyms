A Better Day is Dawning

1.
A better day is coming,
A morning promised long,
When girded Right, with holy Might,
Will overthrow the Wrong;
When God the Lord will listen
To ev’ry plaintive sigh,
And stretch His hand o’er ev’ry land,
With justice by and by.

CHORUS
Coming by and by, coming by and by!
The better day is coming,
The morning draweth nigh!
Coming by and by, coming by and by!
The welcome dawn will hasten on,
'Tis coming by and by.

2.
The boast of haughty Error
No more will fill the air,
But Age and Youth will love the Truth,
And spread it ev’rywhere;
No more from Want and Sorrow
Will come the hopeless cry;
For strife will cease, and perfect Peace
Will flourish by and by.

3.
Oh, for that holy dawning
We watch, and wait, and pray,
Till o’er the height the morning light
Shall drive the gloom away;
And when the heav’nly glory
Shall flood the earth and sky,
We'll bless the Lord for all His word,
And praise Him by and by.
