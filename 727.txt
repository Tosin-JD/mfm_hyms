Hart’s-7.7.
1 Jesus, we Thy promise claim,
We are gather’d in Thy name;
In the midst do Thou appear;
Manifest Thy presence here.

2.
Sanctify all in Thee complete,
Make us all for glory meet
Come and dwell within each heart;
Light, and life, and joy impart.

3.
Make us all in Thee complete,
Make us all for glory meet
Meet t’appear before Thy sight;
Partners with the saints in light!

- C. Wesley
