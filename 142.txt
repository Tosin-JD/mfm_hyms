Farley Castle -10.10.10.10.

1.
Most glorious Lord of life, that on this day
Didst make Thy triumph over death and sin,
And having harrowed hell, didst bring away
Captivity thence captive, us to win:
love, dear Love, like as we ought;
Love is the lesson which the Lord us taught

2.
This joyous day, dear Lord, with joy begin,
And grant that we for whom Thoudiddest die,
Being with Thy dear blood clean washed from sin,
May live for ever in felicity:
love, dear Love, like as we ought;
Love is the lesson which the Lord us taught

3.
And that Thy love we weighing worthily,
May likewise love Thee for the same again;
And for Thy sake, who dost all grace supply,
With love may one another entertain;
love, dear Love, like as we ought;
Love is the lesson which the Lord us taught.

- Edmund Spenser
