The Saviour with me - 8.7.

1.
I would have the Saviour with me,
For I dare not walk alone;
I would feel His presence near me,
And His arm around me thrown.

CHORUS
Then my soul shalt fear no ill,
While He leads me where He will;
I will go without a murmur,
And His footsteps follow still.

2.
I would have the Saviour with me,
For my faith, at best, is weak;
He can whisper words of comfort
That no other voice can speak.

3.
I would have the Saviour with me,
In the onward march of life,
Thro, the tempest and the sun
shine,
Throâ€™ the battle and the strife.

4.
I would have the Saviour with me,
That His eye the way may guide,
Till I reach the vale of Jordan,
Till I cross the rolling tide.

- L. Edwards
