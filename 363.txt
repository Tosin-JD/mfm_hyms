Sitting At the Feet of Jesus

1.
Sitting at the feet of Jesus,
0 what words I hear Him say!
Happy place! so near, so precious!
May it find me there each day!
Sitting at the feet of Jesus,
I would look upon the past;
For His love has been so gracious,
It has won my heart at last.

2.
Sitting at the feet of Jesus,
Where can mortal be more blest?
There I lay my sins and sorrows,
And when weary, find sweet rest;
Sitting at the feet of Jesus,
There I love to weep and pray.
While I from His fullness gather
Grace and comfort ev’ry day.

3.
Bless me, O my Saviour, bless me,
As I sit low at Thy feet;
O look down in love upon me.
Let me see Thy face so sweet;
Give me, Lord, the mind of Jesus,
Make me holy as He is;
May I prove I’ve been with Jesus,
Who is all my righteousness.
