Footsteps -9.4.9.4. with Refrain

1.
Sweetly,"Lord, have we heard Thee calling,
“Come, follow Me!"
And we see where Thy foot prints
falling,Lead us to Thee.

CHORUS
Foot prints of Jesus
that make the pathway glow;
We will follow the steps of Jesus where'er they go.

2 Tho they lead o’er the cold, dark mountains,
Seeking His sheep,
Or along by Siloam’s fountains,
Helping the weak.

3.
If they lead thro’the temple holy,
Preaching the Word,
Or in homes of the poor and lowly,
Serving the Lord

4.
Then at last, when on high He sees us,
Our journey done,
We will rest where the steps of Jesus
End at His throne
