Blessed Quietness

1.
Joys are flowing like a river,
Since the Comforter has come;
He abides with us for ever,
Makes the trusting heart His home.

CHORUS
Blessed quietness, holy quietness,
What assurance in my soul!
On the stormy sea He speaks peace to me,
And the billows cease to roll!

2.
Like the rain that falls from heaven,
Like the sunlight from the sky,
So the Holy Ghost is given,
Coming on us from on high.

3.
What a wonderful salvation!
Where we always see His face;
What a perfect habitation!
What a quiet resting place!
