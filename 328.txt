Coming Home - 8.5.8.5. with Refrain

1.
I’ve wandered far away from God
Now I’m coming home;
The paths of sin too long I've trod
Lord, I'm coming home.

CHORUS
Coming home, coming home,
Never more to roam;
Open now Thine arms of love
Lord, I'm coming home.

2.
I've wasted many precious years
Now I'm coming home;
I now repent with bitter tears
Lord, I'm coming home.

3.
I’ve tired of sin and straying, Lord
Now I’m coming home;
I’m coming home.
I’ll trust Thy love, believe Thy word Lord,

4.
My soul is sick, my heart is sore
Now I’m coming home;
My strength renew, my hope restore
Lord, I’m coming home.

- William J. Kirtpatrick
