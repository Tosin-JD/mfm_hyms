Falls Creek - 8.6.8.7. with Refrain

1.
“Take up thy cross and follow Me,”
I heard my Master say;
“I gave My life to ransom thee,
Surrender your all today.”

CHORUS
Wherever He leads I’ll go,
Wherever He leads I’ll go,
I'll follow my Christ who loves me so,
Wherever He leads I’ll go.

2.
He drew me closer to His side,
I sought His will to know,
And in that will I now abide,
Wherever He leads I’ll go.

3.
It may be through the shadows dim.
Or o’er the stormy sea,
I take my cross and follow Him,
Wherever He leadeth me.

4.
My heart, my life, my all I bring
To Christ who loves me so;
He is my Master, Lord, and King,
Wherever He leads I'll go.

- B. B. McKinney
