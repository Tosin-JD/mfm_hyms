Victory in My Soul

1.
There is vict'ry within my soul;
For the Spirit with me abides
Let the waves of temptation roll,
Jesus keeps me whate'er betides.

CHORUS
Victory! Victory! Vict'ry in my soul;
I have glorious victory since Jesus took control.
Victory! Victory! Sweeping like a flood;
I have glorious victory thro' Jesus blood.

2.
Tho' the conflict be fierce and long,
Tho' the tempter my heart assail;
In my weakness I yet am strong,
For with Jesus I'll e'er prevail.

3.
I have victory over sin,
I have victory o'er the grave;
Even death now has lost its sting,
Hallelujah! I know I'm sav'd.
