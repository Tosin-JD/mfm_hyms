Retreat - L.M.

1.
From ev'ry stormy wind that blows.
From ev’ry swelling tide of woes.
There is a calm, a sure retreat:
‘Tis found beneath the mercy seat

2.
There is a scene where spirits blend,
Where friend holds fellowship with friend;
Though sundered far, by faith they meet
Around one common mercy seat

3.
Ah! Whither could we flee for aid
When tempted, desolate, dismayed
Or how the hosts of hell defeat
Had suffr'ing saints no mercy seat

4.
Ah! there on eagle wings we soar,
And sin and sense molest no more:
And heav’n comes down our souls to greet,
While glory crowns the mercy seat.
