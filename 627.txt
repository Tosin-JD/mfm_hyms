GREAT GOD, WHAT DO I SEE AND HEAR


1.
Great God, what do I see and hear:
The end of things created!
The Judge of mankind doth appear,
On clouds of glory seated.
The trumpet sounds, the graves restore
The dead which they contain'd before:
Prepare, my soul, to meet Him.

2.
The dead in Christ shall first arise,
At the last trumpet's sounding,
Caught up to meet Him in the skies,
With joy their Lord surrounding:
No gloomy fears their souls dismay;
His presence sheds eternal day
On those prepared to meet Him.

3.
But sinners, fill'd with guilty fears,
Behold His wrath prevailing;
For they shall rise, and find their tears
And sighs are unavailing:
The day of grace is past and gone;
Trembling they stand before the throne
All unprepared to meet Him.

4.
Great God, what do I see and hear:
The end of things created!
The Judge of mankind doth appear,
On clouds of glory seated.
Low at His cross I view the day
When heaven and earth shall pass away,
And thus prepared to meet Him.
