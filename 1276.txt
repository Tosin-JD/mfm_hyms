Let’s Just Praise the Lord

1.
We thank You for your kindness.
We thank You for your love,
We've been in heav'nly places,
Felt blessings from above:
We’ve been sharing all the good things,
the family can afford,
Let’s just turn our praise t’ward heaven,
And praise the Lord.

CHORUS
Let’s just praise the Lord!
Praise the Lord!
Let's just lift our hands t’ward heaven
and praise the Lord;
Let's just praise the Lord,
praise the Lord,
Let's just lift our hands t’ward heaven
and praise the Lord.

2.
Just the precious name of Jesus
is worthy of our praise,
Let us bow our knees before Him,
Our hands to heaven raise;
When He comes in clouds of Glory,
with Him to ever reign,
Let’s lift our happy voices,
and praise His dear Name
