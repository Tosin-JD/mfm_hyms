Christchurch -6.6.8.8.

1.
Jerusalem on high
My song and city is,
My home whene’er I die,
The centre of my bliss:

CHORUS
Oh happy place, when shall I be.
My God, with Thee, to see Thy face

2.
There dwells my Lord, my King,
Judged here unfit to live;
There angels to Him sing,
And lowly homage give;

3.
The patriarchs of old
There from their travels cease;
The prophets there behold
Their long’d for Prince of Peace:

4.
The Lamb’s apostles there
I might with joy behold.
The harpers I might hear
Harping on harps of gold:

5.
The bleeding martyrs, they
Within those courts are found,
Clothed in pure array,
Their scars with glory crown’d:

6.
Ah, woe is me, that I
In Kedar’s tents here stay!
No place like that on high;
Lord thither guide my way:
