Tidings

1.
0 Zion, haste, Thy mission high fulfilling,
To tell to all the world that God is Light;
That He who made all nations is not willing
One soul should perish, lost in shades of night.

2.
He comes again; O Zion, ere thou meet Him
Make known to evâ€™ry heart His saving grace;
Let none whom He hath ransomedfail to greet Him,
Thro' thy neglect, unfit to see His face.
