1172
I am Alpha and Omega

1.
My trust I place now and ever
In One my soul can deliver,
A Refuge strong, failing never,
For His word is sure.

CHORUS
I am Alpha and Omega,
The beginning and the ending
Which is and which was,
And which is to come.
I am Alpha and Omega,
The Beginning and the ending,
The Almighty, the Almighty, saith the Lord.

2.
My heart with joy now is telling
Of Him who finds there a dwelling,
Whose love is gently compelling
On His word to rest.

3.
Jehovah, God! Still attend me,
From doubt and fear still defend me,
Faith to sustain ever send me,
That my soul fail not.
