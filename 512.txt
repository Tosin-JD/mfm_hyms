Olivet-D.S.M.

1.
Thou art gone up on high
To mansions in the skies.
And round Thy throne unceasingly
The songs of praise arise.
But we are lingering here,
With sin and care oppress’d;
Lord, send Thy promised Comforter,
And lead us to Thy rest.

2.
Thou art gone up on high:
But Thou didst first come down,
Through earth’s most bitter agony
To pass unto Thy crown:
And girt with griefs and fears
Our onward course must be;
But only let that path of tears
Lead us at last to Thee.

3.
Thou art gone up on high:
But Thou shalt come again
With all the bright one of the sky
Attendeth in Thy train.
Oh by Thy saving power
So make us live and die,
That we may stand in that dread hour,
At Thy right hand on high.
