When You Start For The Land Of Heavenly Rest -11.8.11.8. with Ref.

1.
When you start for the land of heavenly rest,
Keep close to Jesus all 'he way;
For He is the Guide, and He knows the way best;
Keep close to Jesus all the way.

CHORUS
Keep close to Jesus, keep close to Jesus.
Keep close to Jesus all the way;
By day or by night never turn from the right,
Keep close to Jesus all the way.

2.
Never mind the storms of trials as you go.
Keep close to Jesus all the way;
'Tis a comfort and joy His favour to know.
Keep close to Jesus all the way.

3.
To be safe from the dark of the evil one,
Keep close to Jesus all the way;
Take the shield of faith till the victory is won,
Keep close to Jesus all the way.

4.
We shall each our home in heaven by and by,
Keep close to Jesus all the way;
Where to those we love weâ€™ll never say good bye,
Keep close to Jesus all the way.
