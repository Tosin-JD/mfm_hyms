Tallis-7.6.8.6.

1.
I want to be like Jesus
So lowly and so meek;
For no one markâ€™d an angry word.
That ever heard Him speak.

2.
I want to be like Jesus,
So frequently in prayer,
Alone upon the mountain top,
He met His Father there.

3.
I want to be like Jesus:
I never, never find
That He, though persecuted, was
To any one unkind.

4.
I want to be like Jesus,
Engaged in doing good;
So that of me it may be said,
"She hath done what she could."

5.
I want to be like Jesus,
Who sweetly said to all,
"Let little children come to Me;"
I would obey the call.

6.
But oh, I'm not like Jesus,
As any one may see;
O gentle Saviour, send Thy grace,
And make me like to Thee.
