Are you Coming home Tonight?

1.
Are you coming Home,
ye wand’rers Whom Jesus died to win,
All footsore, lame, and weary,
Your garments stain'd with sin?
Will you seek the blood of Jesus
To wash your garments white?
Will you trust His precious promise
Are you coming Home tonight?

CHORUS
Are you coming Home tonight?
Are you coming Home tonight?
Are you coming Home to Jesus,
Out of darkness into light?
Are you coming Home tonight?
Are you coming Home tonight?
To your loving heavenly Father
Are you coming Home tonight?

2.
Are you coming Home,
ye lost ones? Behold, your Lord doth wait;
Come then! no longer linger.
Come ere it be too late!
Will you come, and let Him save
you?Oh, trust His love and might!
Will you come while He is calling?
Are you coming Home tonight?

3.
Are you coming Home, ye guilty,
Who bear and load of sin?
Outside you’ve long been standing,
Come now and venture in!
Will you heed the Saviour’s promise,
And dare trust Him quite?
“Come unto Me!” saith Jesus:
Are you coming Home tonight?
