A Glorious Church

1.
Do you hear them coming, brother?
Thronging up the steeps of light,
Clad in glorious shining garments,
Blood washed garments pure and
white.
CHORUS
â€˜Tis a glorious church without spot
or wrinkle,
HEAVEN
Washed in the blood of the Lamb;
'Tis a glorious church without spot
or wrinkle,
Washed in the blood of the Lamb.

2.
Do you hear the stirring anthems
Filling all the earth and sky?
'Tis a grand, victorious army
Lift its banner up on high!

3.
Never fear the clouds of sorrow,
Never fear the storms of sin;
We shall triumph on the morrow
Even now our joys begin.

4.
Wave the banner, shout His
praises,
For our victory is nigh!
We shall join our conq'ring Saviour,
We shall reign with Him on high!

- Ralph E. Hudson
