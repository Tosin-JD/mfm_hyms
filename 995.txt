We’ll fight till Jesus comes

1.
Summoned my labour ta renew,
And glad to act my part,
Lord, in Thy name my work I do.
And with a single heart.

CHORUS
We’ll fight till Jesus comes.
We’ll work till Jesus comes,
We’ll sing till Jesus comes,
And then we'll lest at home.

2.
End of my every action Thou,
In all things Thee I see;
Accept my offered labour now,
I do it unto Thee.

3.
Servant of all, to toil tor man
Thou didst not, Lord, refuse;
Thy majesty did not disdain
To be employed for us!

4.
Thy bright example I pursue,
To Thee in all things rise;
And all I think, or speak, or do
Is one great sacrifice.

5.
Careless through outward cares I go,
From all distraction free;
My hands are but engaged below,
My heart is still with Thee.
