Redeemed

1.
Sweet is the song I am singing today;
I’m redeemed! I’m redeemed! Trouble and
sorrow have vanished away;
I have been redeemed!

CHORUS
I’m redeemed by love divine,
Glory, glory, Christ is mine,
Christ is mine, All to him
I now resign, I have been redeemed.

2.
Great is my joy now as onward I go;
I’m redeemed! I'm redeemed! AH the way
homeward my praises shall flow;
I have been redeemed!

3.
Precious indeed is my Saviour to me;
I’m redeemed! I’m redeemed! Happy in
glory some day I shall be;
I have been redeemed.
