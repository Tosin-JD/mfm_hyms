St. Peter - C.M.
1 How sweet the name of Jesus sounds
In a believer’s ear!
It soothes his sorrows, heals his wounds,
And drives away his fear.

1.
It makes the wounded spirit whole
And calms the troubled breast;
‘Tis manna to the hungry soul
And to the weary, rest.

2.
Dear name! the rock on which I build,
My shield and hiding place;
My never failing treasury, filled
With boundless stores of grace!

3.
Jesus, my Shepherd, Brother Friend,
My Prophet, Priest and King,
My Lord, my Life, my Way, my End,
Accept the praise I bring.

4.
Till then I would Thy love proclaim
With ev'ry fleeting breath;
And may the music of Thy name
Refresh my soul in death.

- John Newton
