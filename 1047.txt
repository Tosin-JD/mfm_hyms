Jesus Will Be With You

1.
Jesus will be with you wheresoe'er you stray,
Jesus will be with you and will guide
your way;Thro' the lonely deserts, over
mountains bare, ,
Jesus will be with you, brother,
ev'ry where.

CHORUS
Jesus will be with you, Jesus will be with you,
He will be your friend To comfort and defend;
Jesus will be with' you, Jesus will be with you,
Jesus will be with you to the end.

2.
Jesus will be with you wheresoe'er you stray,
Jesus will be with you and will be your stay;
Thro' the darksome valley with its  grief and care,
Jesus will be with you, brother, don't despair.

3.
Jesus will be with you wheresoe'er you stray,
Jesus will be with you all along life's way;
Thro' the chilly waters to the land so fair,
Jesus will be with you, brother, trust his care.

- Rev. J. B. Mackay
