Revive they work, O Lord

1.
Revive Thy work, O Lord!
Thy mighty arm make bare;
Speak with the voice that wakes the dead,
And make Thy people hear!

CHORUS
Revive Thy work, O Lord,
While here to Thee we bow;
Descend, O gracious Lord, descend,
Oh, come and bless us now.

2.
Revive Thy work, O Lord!
Disturb this sleep of death;
Quicken the smould’ring embers now
By Thine Almighty breath.

3.
Revive Thy work, O Lord!
Create soul thirst for Thee;
And hung’ ring for the bread oflife.
Oh, may our spirits be!

4.
Revive Thy work, O Lord!
Exalt Thy precious name:
And by the Holy Ghost, our love
For Thee and Thine inflame.
