I Can Safely Go -11.11.11.11. With Refrain

1.
Any where with Jesus I can safely go;
Anywhere He leads me in this world below;
Anywhere without Him dearest joys would fade;
Anywhere with Jesus I am not afraid.

CHORUS
Anywhere! anywhere! Fear I cannot know;
Anywhere with Jesus I can safely go

2.
Anywhere with Jesus I am not alone.
Other friends may fail me, He is still my own;
Though His hand may lead me over dreary ways.
Anywhere with Jesus is a house of praise.

3.
Anywhere with Jesus over land and sea,
Telling souls in darkness of salvation free;
Ready as He summons me to go or stay,
Anywhere with Jesus He points the way.
