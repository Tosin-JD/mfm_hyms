1.
Teach me, O Lord, Thy holy way.
And give me an obedient mind,
That in Thy service I may find
My soul’s delight from day to day.

0 Help me, O Saviour, here to trace
The sacred footsteps Thou hast trod;
And, meekly walking with my God,
To grow in goodness, truth, and grace.

3.
Guard me, O Lord, that I may ne’er
Forsake the right, or do the wrong;
Against temptation make me strong,
And round me spread Thy shelteringcare.

4.
Bless me in every task, O Lord,
Begun, continued, done for Thee;
Fulfil Thy perfect work in me.
And Thine abounding grace afford.

- William Matson
