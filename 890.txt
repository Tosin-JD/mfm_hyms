Come home

1.
O soul in the far away county
Aweary and famished, and sad,
Thereâ€™s rest in the home of thy Father,
His welcome will make thy heart glad.

CHORUS
Come home come home,
Oh, why will you longer roam?
Come home come home,
O prodigal child, come home.

2.
Arise and come back to thy Father,
He'll meet thee while yet on the way,
Assured of His tender compassion,
Oh why wilt thou longer delay?

3.
Although thou hast sinned against heaven,
And weak and unworthy may be,
He offers thee full restoration.
And pardon abundant and free.
