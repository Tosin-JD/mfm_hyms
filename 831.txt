Colne

1.
Blest be the dear uniting love
That will not let us part;
Although our bodies for remove,
We still are one in heart.

2.
Joined one spirit to our Head,
Where He appoints we go;
And still in Jesus’ steps we tread,
And show His praise below.

3.
Oh! may we ever walk in Him,
And nothing know beside,
Nothing desire or e’en esteem
But Jesus crucified!

4.
Closer and closer let us cleave
To His beloved embrace,
Expect His fullness to receive.
And grace to answer grace.

5.
Partakers of the Saviour's grace,
The same in mind and heart.
Nor joy, nor grief, nor time, nor
place,
Not life, nor death can part.

6.
But we look forward to the day
Which shall our flesh restore,
When death shall all be done away,
And we shall part no more.

- Charles Wesley
