I am Coming to the Cross - 7.7.

1.
I am coming to the cross;
I am poor, and weak, and blind;
I am counting all but dross;
I shall full salvation find.

CHORUS
I am trusting, Lord, in Thee,
Blessed Lamb of Calvary;
Humbly at Thy cross I bow;
Save me, Jesus, save me now.


2.
Long my heart has sigh’d for Thee,
Long has evil reign’d within;
Jesus sweetly speaks to me
' “I will cleanse you from all sin.”

3.
Here I give my all to Thee,
Friends, and time, and earthly
store,
Soul and body Thine to be
Wholly Thine for evermore.

4.
Jesus comes! He fills my soul!
Perfected in Him I am;
I am every whit made whole;
Glory, glory to the Lamb!

5.
Still I’m trusting, Lord, in Thee,
Blessed Lamb of Calvary;
Humbly at Thy cross I bow;
Jesus saves me, saves me now!
