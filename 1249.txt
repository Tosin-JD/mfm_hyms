Rickmansworth - 8.3.8.3.

1.
Jesus, the children are calling;
O draw near!
Fold the young lambs in Thy bosom,
Shepherd dear.

2.
Slow are our footsteps and filing,
Oft we fall;
Jesus the children are calling;
Hear their call!

3.
Cold is our love, Lord, and narrow;
Large is Thine, ;
Faithful, and strong and tender:
So be mine!

4.
Gently, Lord, lead Thou our mothers;
Weary they;
Bless all our sisters and brothers
Night and day.

5.
Fathers themselves are God’s children;
Teach them still;
Let the good Spirit show all men
God’s wise will.
