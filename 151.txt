1.
What are those Sabbaths of joy without end,
Angels in light and the glorified spend:
Rest for the weary; for victors reward;
There God Himself all and in all adored?

2.
Who is the Monarch? who circle His throne?
What is the calm restful bliss of His own?
Tell us, ye blessed ones worshipping there,
Tell us, if words can your rapture declare.

3.
Oh true Jerusalem, city most bright,
Whose perfect peace is eternal delight:
Longings in thee are fulfill’d, ere express’d;
More than was long’d for
embraced and possess

4.
Troubles all past, in the courts of our King
We without fear Zion’s anthems shall sing,
Off ring Thee, Lord, in Thy presence above
Love’s pure responses for gifts of Thy love.

5.
There never Sabbath to Sabbath
gives place:
One is their Sabbath who gaze
on Thy face.
There never cease heaven’s
jubilee songs,
Chanted by saints and by sweet
angel tongues.

6.
Meantime in heart and with faith-
winged prayersSeek we our Fatherland yonder and theirs;
While to Jerusalem bounden we roam,
Exiles returning from Babylon homo.

7.
Now before Him we adoringly fall,
Of whom and through whom and in whom are all;
Of whom the Father, and through whom the Son,
In whom the Spirit of Both, ever One.
