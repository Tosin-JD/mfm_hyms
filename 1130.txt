Ein’ Feste Burg -8.7.8.7.6.6.6.6.7.

1.
God is our fortress and our rock,
our mighty help in danger;
he shields us from the battle’s shock
and thwarts the devil’s anger:
for still the prince of night
prolongs his evil fight;
he uses every skill
to work his wicked will
no earthly force is like him.

2.
Our hope is fixed on Christ alone,
the Man, of God’s own choosing;
without him nothing can be won
and fighting must be losing:
so let the powers accursed
come on and do their worst,
the Son of God shall ride
to battle at our side,
and he shall have the victory.

3.
The word of God will not be slow
while demon hordes surround us,
though evil strike its cruellest blow
and death and hell confound us:
for even if distress
should take all we possess,
and those who mean us ill
should ravage, wreck, or kill,
God’s kingdom is immortal!

- Martin Luther
