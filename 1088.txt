His promise to me

1.
Darkness may o’ertake me and my song forsake me,
But alone I never shall be;
For the Friend beside me promised He would guide me
And will keep His promise to me.

CHORUS
He will keep His promise to me,
All the way with me He will go;
He has never broken any promise spoken;
He will keep His promise, I know.

2.
Should misfortune meet me, friends may fail to greet me.
But if true to Jesus I stay
He will still uphold me, let His love
enfold meEv’ry dreary mile of the way.

3.
How the tho’t enthralls me, that whate’er befalls me
One will always love me the same;
Not a trial ever causes Him to sever
From the ones who honour His name.
