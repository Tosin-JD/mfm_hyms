Even Me

1.
Lord, I hear of showers of blessing
Thou art scattering full and free;
Showers the thirsty land refreshing;
Let some drops now fall on me,
Even me, Even me,
Let some drops now fall on me.

2.
Pass me not, O gracious Father,
Sinful though my heart may be;
Thou might'st leave me, but the rather
Let Thy mercy light on me,
Even me, Even me,
Let Thy mercy light on me.

3.
Pass me not, O tender Saviour,
Let me love and cling to Thee;
I am longing for Thy favour;
Whilst Thouâ€™rt calling, O call me,
Even me, Even me,
Whilst Thou'rt calling, O call me.

4.
Love of God, so pure and change less,
Blood of Christ, so rich, so free,
Grace of God, so strong and boundless,
Magnify them all in me,
Even me, Even me,
Magnify them all in me.

- Elizabeth Codner
