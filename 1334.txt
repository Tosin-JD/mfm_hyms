Call For Workers

1.
In the vineyard of the Lord,
There is work for all to do;
Will you go and work today,
With a purpose strong and true?

CHORUS
Heed the call, brother dear.
For workers today;
Let your eyes see the need
Of workers, today.

2.
Brother, sister, hear the call!
All along, your aid afford;
Let us strive to save the lost
Strive to save by work and word.

3.
Mark the spiritâ€™s direful fate.
Wheresoever sin is found;
Come, and lend a helping hand,
Let the shackles be unbound.

4.
Oh, for workers strong and brave.
Who will lift the banner high;
So the lost can see the way.
To the mansions in the sky.
