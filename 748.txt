Jesus, My Strength, My Hope - D.S.M.

1.
Jesus, my strength, my hope,
On Thee I cast my care,
With humble confidence look up,
And know Thou hearâ€™st my prayer.
Give me on Thee to wait,
Till I can all things do,
On Thee, Almighty to create,
Almighty to renew.

2.
I want a godly fear,
A quick-discerning eye
That looks to Thee when sin is near,
And sees the tempter fly;
A spirit still prepared,
And armed with jealous care,
For ever standing on its guard
And watching unto prayer.

3.
I want a true regard,
A single, steady aim,
Unmoved by threatening or reward,
To Thee and Thy great name;
A jealous, just concern
For Thine immortal praise;
A pure desire that all may learn
And glorify Thy grace.

4.
I rest upon Thy word;
The promise is for me;
My succour and salvation, Lord,
Shall surely come from Thee:
But let me still abide,
Nor from my hope remove,
Till Thou my patient spirit guide
Into Thy perfect love.
