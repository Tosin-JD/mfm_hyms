Calvary Covers It All

1.
Far dearer than all that the world can impart
Was the message that came to my heart;
How that Jesus alone for my sin did atone,
And Calvary covers it all.

CHORUS
Calvary- covers it all,
My past with its sin and stain;
My guilt and despair Jesus took on
Him there,And Calvary covers it all

2.
The stripes that He bore and the
thorns that He wore
Told His mercy and love evermore;
And my heart bowed in shame, as I
called on His name,
And Calvary covers it all.

3.
How matchless the grace, when I
looked in the face
Of this Jesus, my crucified Lord;
My redemption complete I then
found at His feet,
And Calvary covers it all.

4.
How blessed the thought, that my
soul by Him bought.
Shall be His in the glory on high;
Where with gladness and song Iâ€™ll
be one of the throng,
And Calvary covers it all.

- Mrs. Walter G. Taylor
