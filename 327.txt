Othello - C.M. with Refrain

1.
I have a song I love to sing,
Since I have been redeemed,
Of my Redeemer, Saviour, King,
Since I have been redeemed.

CHORUS
Since I have been redeemed,
Since I have been redeemed,
I will glory in His name;
Since I have been redeemed,
I will glory in my Saviour’s name.

2.
I have a Christ who satisfies,
Since I have been redeemed,
To do His will my highest prize,
Since I have been redeemed.

3.
I have a witness bright and clear,
Since I have been redeemed,
Dispelling every doubt and fear,
Since I have been redeemed.

4.
I have a home prepared for me,
Since I have been redeemed,
Where I shall dwell eternally.
Since I have been redeemed.

- Edwin O. Excell
