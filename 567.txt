Cuthbert - 8.6.8.4.

1.
Our bless'd Redeemer, ere He breathed
His tender last farewell,
A Guide, a comforter, bequeath'd
With us to dwell.

2.
He came in semblance of a dove,
With sheltering wings outspread,
The holy balm of peace and love
On earth to shed.

3.
He came sweet influence to impart,
A gracious, willing Guest,
While He can find one humble heart
Wherein to rest.

4.
And His that gentle voice we hear
Soft as the breath of even,
That checks each fault, that calms each fear,
And speaks of heaven.

5.
And every virtue we possess,
And every victory won,
And every thought of holiness,
Are His alone.

6.
Spirit of purity and grace,
Our weakness, pitying, see;
Oh make our hearts Thy dwelling place,
And meet for Thee.

- J. B. Dykes
