Glory to God, Hallelujah

1.
We are never, never weary of the grand old song; 
Glory to God, Hallelujah!
We can sing it loud as ever with our faith more strong;
Glory to God, Hallelujah!

CHORUS
O the children of the Lord
have a right to shout and sing!
For the way is growing bright,
and our souls are on the wing;
We are going by and bye
to the palace of a King
Glory to God, Hallelujah!

2.
We are lost amid the rapture of redeeming love;
Glory to God, Hallelujah!
We are rising on its pinons to the Hills above;
Glory to God, Hallelujah!

3. 
We are going to a palace that is built of gold;
Glory to God, Hallelujah!
Where the King in all His splendour we shall soon behold;
Glory to God, Hallelujah!

4.
There we’ll shout redeeming mercy in a glad new song;
Glory to God, Hallelujah!
There we’ll sing the praise of Jesus with the blood wash’d throng;
Glory to God, Hallelujah!
