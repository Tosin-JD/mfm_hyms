Heilein -7.7.7.7.

1.
Forty days and forty nights
you were fasting in the wild;
forty days and forty nights
tempted and yet undefiled.

2.
Burning heat throughout the day,
bitter cold when light had fled;
prowling beasts around your way,
stones your pillow, earth your bed.

3.
Shall not we your trials share,
learn your discipline of will;
and with you by fast and power
wrestle with powers of hell?

4.
So if Satan, pressing hard,
soul and body would destroy:
Christ who conquered, be our
guard;
give to us the victorâ€™s joy.

5.
Saviour, may we hear your voice
keep us constant at your side;
and with you we shall rejoice
at the eternal Eastertide.

- G. H. Smyttan
