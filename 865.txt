Come with Me, Visit Calvary - 7.6.7.6.D. with Refrain

1.
Come with me, visit Calvary,
Where our Redeemer died;
His blood, it fills the fountain,
"Tis full, ‘tis deep, ‘tis wide.
He died from sin to sever,
Our hearts and lives complete;
He saves and keeps for ever
Those lying at His feet.

CHORUS
To the uttermost He saves.
To the uttermost He saves,
Dare you now believe and His love receive.
To the uttermost Jesus saves.

2.
I will surrender fully,
And do His blessed will;
His blood doth make me holy.
His presence me doth fill.
He’s saving. I’m believing.
This blessed now I claim;
His Spirit I’m receiving,
My heart is in a flame.

3.
I’ve wondrous peace through trusting,
A well of joy within;
This rest is everlasting.
Each day I triumph win,
He gives me heavenly measure
‘Pressed down’ and 'running o’er,’
Oh, what a priceless treasure.
Glory for evermore!
