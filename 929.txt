St. Magnus - C. M.

1.
Awake, my soul, stretch every nerve,
And press with vigour on;
A heavenly race demands thy zeal,
And an immortal crown.

2.
A cloud of witnesses around
Hold thee in full survey:
Forget the steps already trod
And onward urge thy way.

3.
‘Tis God’s all animating voice
That calls thee from on high;
‘Tis His own hand presents the prize
To thine aspiring eye:

4.
That prize, with peerless glories bright.
Which shall new lustre boast,
When victors' wreaths and monarchs’ gems
Shall blend in common dust.

5.
Blest Saviour, introduced by Thee
Have I my race begun;
And crowned with victory, at Thy feet
I’ll lay my honours down.

- Phillip Doddridge
