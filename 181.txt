Once Again The Gospel Message- 8.7.8.7.

1.
Once again the Gospel message
From the Saviour you have heard;
Will you heed the invitation?
Will you turn and seek the Lord?

CHORUS
Come believing! Come believing!
Come to Jesus! Look and live!
Come believing! Come believing!
Come to Jesus! Look and live!

2.
Many summers you have wasted.
Ripened harvests you have seen;
Winter snows by spring have melted.
Yet you linger in your sir.

3.
Jesus for your choice is waiting;
Tarry not: at once decide!
While the Spirit now is striving,
Yield, and seek the Saviour’s side.

4.
Cease of fitness to be thinking;
Do no longer try to feel;
It is trusting, and not feeling.
That will give the Spirit's seal.

5.
Let your will to God be given,
Trust in Christ’s atoning blood;
Look to Jesus now in heaven.
Rest to His unchanging word.
