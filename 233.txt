Decide Now

1.
O wanderer, come, this hour decide
The path thy heart will choose!
Say, wilt thou live for Christ alone
Oh, canst thou still refuse?

CHORUS
Decide now, decide now!
The Saviour is tenderly calling thee;
Decide now, decide now!
Tomorrow may never be.

2.
Behold, He stands with open arms
To give thee life and light;
His word believe. His grace receive
Oh, come, be saved tonight!

3.
Decide for Him, thy dearest Friend
Why wilt thou yet delay?
What thoâ€™ thy sins are crimson red.
He'll wash them all away.

4.
No other name but His can save;
Then haste His love to share:
Throw open wide thy yielding heart,
And He will enter there.
