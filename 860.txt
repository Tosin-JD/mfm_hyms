Come, Hear His Word

1.
Come, hear His Word, God’s servants now are speaking,
Draw near to Him, and all dark cares dismiss,
You shall be free, all those who comfort seeking,
May have a taste of heav’nly joy and bliss.

CHORUS
Have you in truth the love of Jesus known,
Then tell the world you are His very own.
Have you in truth the love of Jesus known,
Then tell the world you are His very own.

2.
Believe in God and follow His anointed,
Who guide us on the path to heav’nly peace.
The leaders who the Lord Himself appointed,
To offer grace, God's love will never cease.

3.
If some there be who love not those who serve us,
How can they grasp the love of Christ aright.
Nor can they see how faith and pray’r preserve us,
And lead to Zion’s mount of wondrous light.
