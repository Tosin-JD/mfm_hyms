There Is No Night In Heaven - S.M.

1.
There is no night in heaven;
In that blest world above
Work never can bring weariness,
For work itself is love.

2.
There is no grief in heaven;
For life is one glad day;
And tears are of those former things
Which all have passâ€™d away.

3.
There is no sin in heaven;
Behold that blessed throng
All holy is their spotless robe,
All holy is their song.

4.
There is no death in heaven;
For they who gain that shore
Have won their immortality,
And they can die no more.

5.
Lord Jesus, be our Guide;
O lead us safely on,
Till night and grief and sin and death
Are past, and heav'n is won!
