1169
Yield not to temptation

1.
Yield not to temptation. For yielding is sin;
Each vict’ry will help you Some other to win;
Fight manfully onward, Dark passions subdue;
Look over to Jesus. He’ll carry you through.

CHORUS
Ask the Saviour to help you,
Comfort, strengthen and keep you;
He is willing to aid you,
He will carry you through.

2.
Shun evil companions, Bad language disdain;
God’s name hold in reverence, Nor take it in vain;
Be thoughtful and earnest, Kind- hearted and true;
Look ever to Jesus, He’ll carry you
through.

3.
To him that o’ercometh God giveth a crown;
Thro’ faith we will conquer, Tho’ often cast down;
He who is our Saviour, Our strength will renew;
Look ever to Jesus, He’ll carry you through.

- Horatio R. Palmer
