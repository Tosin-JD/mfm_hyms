Dunbar - 8.8.8.6. with Refrain

1.
My life, my love' I give to Thee,
Thou Lamb of God who died for me;
0 may I ever faithful be,
My Saviour and my God!

CHORUS
I’ll live for Him who died for me,
How happy then my life shall be!
I’ll live for Him who died for me,
My Saviour and my God!

2.
I now believe Thou dost receive,
For Thou hast died that I might live;
And now hence-forth I'll trust in Thee,
My Saviour and my God!

3.
O Thou who died on Calvary,
To save my soul and make me free,
I'll consecrate my life to Thee,
My Saviour and my God!

- Ralph E. Hudson
