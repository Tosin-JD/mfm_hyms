Dunelm - L.M.

1.
Jesus, where'er Thy people meet,
There they behold Thy mercy seat;
Where'er they seek Thee, Thou art found,
And every place is hallow'd ground.

2.
For Thou within no walls confined,
Inhabitest the humble mind;
Such ever bring Thee where they come,
And going take Thee to their home.

3.
Dear Shepherd of Thy chosen few,
Thy former mercies here renew;
Here to our waiting hearts proclaim
The sweetness of Thy saving name.

4.
Here may we prove the power of prayer
To strengthen faith and sweeten care;
To teach our faint desires t J rise.
And bring all heaven before our eyes.

5.
Lord, we are few, Thou art near;
Nor short Thine arm, nor deaf Thine ear;
Oh rend the heavens, come quickly down,
And make all hearts, O Lord, Thine own.
