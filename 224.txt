224
Won’t you let Him be your Saviour too

1.
I have a precious Saviour, He came from heav’n above,
And died for me on Calvary. To prove his matchless love.
The love so freely given. HE offers now to you;
Won't you let my Saviour Be your Saviour too?

CHORUS
Won’t you let him be your Saviour too?
He would prove a faithful friend to you;
He would purify your soul, keep you ever pure and whole;
Won’t you let my Saviour Be your Saviour too?

2.
I have a loving Saviour, He hears me when I call;
He helps to bear each load of care,
And lifts me when I fall;
So kind is he, so tender, Compassionate and true;
Won’t you let my Saviour Be your Saviour too?

3.
I have a faithful Saviour; With me he will abide;
And hold my hand until I land upon the other side,
Someday in all his glory, My Saviour shall view;
Brother, won’t you let him Be your Saviour too?
