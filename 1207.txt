I Know There Is Power In Jesus’ Blood

1.
I know there is power in Jesus' blood
For He washed my sins away,
And I know there is joy in serving Him
For He turned my night to day.

CHORUS
There is power, power wonder working power
There is power, power, purifying power,
There is power in Jesus blood.

2.
I know there is power in Jesus’ blood,
From my guilt He set me free;
When I came unto Him with all my sins
And His blood availed for me.

3.
I know there is power in Jesus’ blood,
For all things have been made new;
Since His own precious blood has been applied
And has cleansed me through and through.
