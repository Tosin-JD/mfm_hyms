In The City Where the Lamb Is Light

1.
There’s a country far beyond the starry sky.
There’s a city where there never comes a night;
If we’re faithful we shall go there by and by,
’Tis the city where the Lamb is the light.

CHORUS
In that city where the Lamb is the light.
The city where there cometh no night;
I've a mansion over there.
And when free from toil and care,
I am going where the Lamb is the light.

2.
Here we have our days of sunshine, but we know
That the sun which shines upon us now so bright
Will be changed to clouds and rain until we go
To the city where the Lamb is the light

3.
There the flowers bloom forever,
and the dayShall be an eternal day without a night;
And our tears shall be forever wiped away,
In that city where the Lamb is the light

4.
Here we have our disappointments all the while,
Arid our fondest hopes but meet with bitter blight;
Tho' by night we weep, the morning brings smile,
In that city where the Lamb is the light.

2.
Then let sunlight fade, let the twilight bring its gloom,
Not a shadow can my blissful soul affright; '
For I know that up in heaven there is room,
In that city where the Lamb is the light.
