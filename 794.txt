What Is The Thing That I Long Far - L.M.

1.
What is the thing that I long for?
What is my hope or my desire?
How I crave to follow the Lamb
And I His image to adopt.

2.
All my hope, Lord on Thee is stayed
I long to be the one you love
I want to be saved here on earth
And fellowship with Thee above.

3.
I hunger for the Lord of life
Who died for me on Calvary
For the source of water and blood
That from Thy wounded side which flowed.

4.
I desire Thy water of love
Spirit of joy thatâ€™s yet unknown
Grant that I may yet drink above
As it does stream forth from Thy throne.
