Mendelssohn -7.7.7.7.D. with Refrain

1.
Hark! The herald angels sing
Glory to the new born King.
Peace on earth and mercy mild,
God and sinners reconciled!
Joyful all ye nations rise,
Join the triumph of the skies;
With the angelic host proclaim,
‘Christ is born in Bethlehem.’

CHORUS
Hark! The herald angels sing
Glory to the new born King.

2.
Christ, by highest heaven adored;
Christ, the everlasting Lord;
Late in time behold Him come,
Offspring of a virgin’s womb:
Veiled in flesh the God head see;
Hail the incarnate Deity,
Pleased as Man with man to dwell,
Jesus our Emmanuel!

3.
Hail the heaven born Prince of peace,
Hail the Sun of righteousness;
Light and life to all He brings,
Risen with healing in His wings,
Mild, He lays His glory by,
Born that man no more may die,
Born to raise the sons of earth,
Born to give them second birth.

4.
Come, Desire of nations, come.
Fix in us Thy humble home;
Rise, the woman’s conquering seed,
Bruise in us the serpent’s head.
Adam’s likeness, Lord, efface;
Stamp Thy image in its place;
O, to all Thyself impart,
Formed in each believing heart.

- Charles Wesley
