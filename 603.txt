That will be Heaven for me


1.
I know not the hour when my Lord will come
To take me away to His own,dear home;
But I know that His presence will lighten the gloom,
And that will be glory for me.
And that will be glory for me;
Oh, that will be glory for me;
But I know that His presence will lighten the gloom,
And that will be glory for me.

2.
I know not the song that the angels sing,
I know not the sound of the harps’ glad ring;
But I know there’ll be mention of
Jesus our King,
And that will be music for me.
And that will be music for me;
Oh, that will be music for me;
But I know there’ll be mention of Jesus our King,
And that will be music for me.

3.
I know not the form of my mansion fair,
I know not the name that I then shall bear;
But I know that my Saviour will welcome me there,
And that will be heaven for me.
And that will be heaven for me;
Oh, that will be heaven for me;
But I know that my Saviour will welcome me there,
And that will be heaven for me.
