As pants the hart for cooling Streams - C.M.

1.
As pants the hart for cooling streams,
When heated in the chase,
So longs my souls, O God. for Thee,
And Thy refresing grace.

2.
For Thee, my God, the living God,
My thirsty soul doth pine;
O when shall I behold Thy face.
Thou Majesty divine!

3.
Why restless, why cast down, my soul!
Trust God. who will employ,
His aid for thee and change these sighs
To thankful hymns of joy.

4.
God of my strength, how long shall
Like one forgotten, mourn!
Forlorn, forsaken, and exposed
To my oppressorâ€™s scorn.

5.
Why restless, why cast down, my soul!
Hope still, and thou shalt sing
The praise of Him who is thy God,
Thy health's eternal spring.
