Laus Deo - 6.4.6.4.

1.
Father of heaven above,
Dwelling in light and love,
Ancient of days,
Light unapproachable,
Love inexpressible,
Thee, the Invisible,
Laud we and praise.

2.
Christ the eternal Word,
Christ the incarnate Lord,
Saviour of all,
High throned above all height,
God of God, Light of Light,
Increate infinite,
On Thee we call.

3.
O God, the Holy Ghost,
Whose fires of Pentecost
Burn evermore,
In this far wilderness
Leave us not comfortless:
Thee we love, Thee we bless,
Thee we adore.

4.
Strike your harps, heavenly powers
With your glad chants shall ours
Trembling ascend
All praise, O God, to Thee,
Three in One, One in Three,
Praise everlastingly
World without end.
