Pure and Holy - 7.7.7.7. and Refrain

1.
Pure and holy I would be,
worthy of Your love for me.
Teach me while Your light is clear,
change me while my heart is near.

CHORUS
Holy, holy, holy Lord.
Holy, holy, holy Lord

2.
You are great and I am small,
You are King and God of all.
You are wise in all You do,
Lord I put my trust in You.
