Christus der ist mein Leben - 7.67.6.

1.
We lift our hearts, O Father,
To Thee our voices raise,
For these Thy suppliant servants.
In mingled prayer and praise:

2.
Praise for the joy of loving.
All other joys above,
Praise for the priceless blessing
Of loveâ€™s response to love;

3.
Prayer that the glad surrender
Of self may perfect be,
That each be one with other,
And both be one in Thee;

4.
Prayer that Thou wilt accomplish
The promise of today.
And crown the years with blessing
That shall not pass away;

5.
Praise for the hope most glorious
That looks beyond the veil,
Where faith and hope shall vanish.
But love shall never fail.

- E. A. Welch
