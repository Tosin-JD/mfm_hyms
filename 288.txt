Come, O Come, When Christ is Calling - 8.7.8.7. with Ref

1.
Come, O come, when Christ is calling,
Linger not in paths of sir;
Sever ev’ry tie that binds you,
And the Heav'nly race begin.

CHORUS
Calling now, calling now;
Hear the Saviour calling now;
Calling now, calling now,
Hear the Saviour calling now.

2.
Come, oh come, while Christ is pleading;
Oh, what love His tones convey!
Will you slight His proffer'd mercy,
Will you longer from Him stray!

3.
Come, oh come, delay no longer,
For th’ accepted time is now;
Yield, oh yield yourself to Jesus,
And before His sceptre bow.
