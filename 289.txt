Come To The Saviour, Make No Delay - P.M.

1.
Come to the Saviour, make no delay;
Here in His world He has shown us the way;
Here in our midst He’s standing today,
Tenderly saying, “Come”

CHORUS
Joyful, joyful, will the meeting be,
When from sin our hearts are pure and free;
And we shall gather, Saviour, with Thee,
In our eternal home.

2.
“Suffer the children!" Oh, hear His voice!
Let ev’ry heart leap forth and rejoice;
And let us freely make Him our choice;
Do not delay, but come.

3.
Think once again, He’s with us today;
Heed now His blest command and obey;
Hear now His accents tenderly say,
“Will you, my children, come?”
