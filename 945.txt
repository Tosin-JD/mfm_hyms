Monks gate

1.
He who would valiant be
'Gainst all disaster,
Let him in constancy
Follow the Master,
there’s no discouragement
Shall make him once relent
His first avowed intent
To be a pilgrim.

2.
Who so beset him round
With dismal stories,
Do but themselves confound
His strength the more is.
No foes shall stay his might,
Though he with giants flight:
He will make good his right
To be a pilgrim.

3.
Since, Lord, thou dost defend
Us with thy Spirit,
We know we at the end
Shall life inherit.
Then fancies flee away!
I’ll fear not what men say,
I’ll labour night and day
To be a pilgrim.

- John Bunyan
