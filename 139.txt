St. Hugh - C.M.

1.
Behold, we come, dear Lord, to Thee,
And bow before Thy throne;
We come to offer on our knee
Our vows to Thee alone.

2.
Whate'er we have, whate'er we are,
Thy bounty freely gave;
Thou dost us here in mercy spare,
And wilt hereafter save.

3.
Come then, my soul, bring all thy powers,
And grieve thou hast no more;
Bring every day thy choicest hours,
And thy great God adore.

4.
But, above all, prepare thine heart
On this, His own blest day,
in its sweet task to bear thy part,
And sing and love and pray.

- J. Austin
