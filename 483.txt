Victory - 8.8.8. with Refrain

1.
Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!
The strife is o'er, the battle done;
Now is the Victor’s triumph won;
O let the song of praise be sung;
Alleluia!

2.
Death’s mightiest powers have
done their worst,
And Jesus hath His foes
dispersed;Let shouts of praise and joy outburst:

3.
On the third morn He rose again
Glorious in majesty to reign;
O let us swell the joyful strain:
4 He brake the age bound chains of hell,
The bars from heaven’s high portals fell;
Let hymns of praise His triumph tell:

4.
Lord, by the stripes which wounded Thee,
From death’s dread sting Thy servants free,
That we may live, and sing to Thee.
Alleluia!

- Latin, 17th cent.
