Fiat lux -6.6.4.4.

1.
Lord of all power and might,
Father of love and light,
Speed on Thy word:
Oh let the Gospel sound,
All the wide world around,
Wherever man is found;
God speed His word.

2.
Hail, blessed Jubilee:
Thine, Lord, the glory be;
Hallelujah!
Thine was the mighty plan,
From Thee the work began;
Away with praise of man,
Glory to God!

3.
Lo, what embattled foes,
Stern in their hate, oppose Godâ€™s holy word:
One for His truth we stand,
Strong in His own right hand,
Firm as a martyr bank;
God shield His word.

4.
Onward shall be our course,
Despite of fraud or force;
God is before;
His word ere long shall run
Free as the noon day sun;
His purpose must be done:
God bless His word.
