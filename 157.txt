Spanish Chant - 7.7.7.7.7.7.

1.
Come, divine Interpreter,
Bring us eyes Thy Book to read.
Ears the mystic words to hear.
Words which did from Thee proceed,
Words that endless bliss impart,
Kept in an obedient heart.

2.
All who read, or hear, areblessed,
If Thy plain commands we do;
Of Thy kingdom here possessed.
Thee we shall in glory view:
When Thou comâ€™st on earth to abide,
Reign triumphant at Thy side

- Charles Wesley
