1.
My God, now is your table spread,
your cup with love still overflows:
so may your children here be fed
as Christ to us his goodness shows.

2.
This holy feast, which Jesus makes
a banquet of his flesh and blood
how glad is he who comes and
takes
this sacred drink, this royal food!

3.
His gifts that richly satisfy
are yet to some in vain displayed:
did not for them the Saviour die
may they not share the childrenâ€™s
bread?

4.
My God, here let your table be
a place of joy for all your guests,
and may each one salvation see
who now its sacred pledges taste.

- P. Doddridge
