Today The Saviour Calls - 6.4.6.4.

1.
Today the Saviour calls:
Ye wand'rers, come
Oh, ye benighted souls.
Why longer roam?1. Today the Saviour calls:
Oh, listed now!
Within these sacred walls
To Jesus bow

2.
Today the Saviour calls;
For refuge fly;
The storm of justice falls
And death is nigh.

3.
The Spirit calls today;
Yield to His power;
Oh, grieve Him not away!
'Tis mercy hour.
