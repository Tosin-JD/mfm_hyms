St. Agnes - C.M.

1.
Approach, my soul, the mercy-seat,
Where Jesus answers prayer;
There humbly fall before His feet,
For none can perish there.

2.
Thy promise is my only plea,
With this I venture nigh:
Thou callest burden’d souls to Thee,
And such, O Lord, am I.

3.
Bow’d down beneath a load of sin,
By Satan sorely press’d,
By war without,'and fears within,
I come to Thee for rest.

4.
Be Thou my shield and hiding place,
That, shelter'd near Thy side,
I may my fierce accuser face,
And tell him, Thou hast died.

5.
Oh, wondrous love, to bleed and
die,To bear the cross and shame,
That guilty sinners, such as i,
Might plead Thy gracious name.

- J. B. Dykes
