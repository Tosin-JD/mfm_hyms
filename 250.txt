Him that is Thirsty

1.
Ho! ev’ry one that is thirsty in spirit,
Ho! ev’ry one that is weary and sad;
Come to the fountain, there’s fullness in Jesus,
All that you’re longing for, come and be glad.

CHORUS
I will pour water on him that is thirsty,
I will pour flood upon the dry ground;
Open your heart for the gift I am bringing;
While ye are seeking Me, I will be found.

2.
Child of the world, are you tired ofyour bondage?
Weary of earth joys, so false, so untrue?
Thirsting for God and His fullness of blessing?
List to the promise, a message for you!

3.
Child of the Kingdom, he fill'd with the Spirit!
Nothing but fullness thy longing can meet:
'Tis the endurement for life and for service;
Thine is the promise, so certain, so sweet.
