Binghamton -10.11.11.11. with Refrain

1.
My Father is rich in houses and lands,
He holdeth the wealth of the world in His hands!
Of rubies and diamonds, of silver and gold,
His coffers are full, He has riches untold.

CHORUS
I’m a child of the King, 
A child of the King:
With Jesus my Saviour, 
I’m a child of the King.

2.
My Father’s own Son, the Saviour c men,
Once wandered on earth as the poorest of them;
But now He is reigning forever on high,
And will give me a home in heav’n by and by.

3.
I once was an outcast stranger on earth,
A sinner by choice, and an alien by birth;
But I’ve been adopted, my name's written down,
An heir to a mansion, a robe, and a crown.

4.
A tent or a cottage, why should I care?
They’re building a palace for me over there;
Though exiled from home, yet still I may sing;
All glory to God, I’m a child of the King.

- Harriet E. Buell
