Invitation – 6.6.6.6.D.

1.
Come to the Saviour now,
He gently calleth thee;
In true repentance bow,
Before Him bend the knee;
He waiteth to bestowSalvation, peace, and love,
True joy on earth below,
A home in heaven above.

2.
Come to the Saviour now,
Ye who have wandered far;
Renew your solemn vow,
For His by right you are;
Come, like poor wandering sheep
Returning to His fold;
His arm will safely keep,
His love will ne’er grow cold.

3.
Come to the Saviour, all,
Whate’er your burdens be;
Hear now His loving call,
“Cast all your care on Me.”
Come, and for every grief
In Jesus you will find
A sure and safe relief,
A loving friend and king.
