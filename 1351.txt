1351
Saved to Serve

1.
Going forth at Christ’s command,
Going forth to ev’ry land;
Full salvation making known,
Thro’ the blood of God’s dear Son.

CHORUS
“Saved to serve!” the watchword ring,
Saved to serve our glorious King;
Tell the story o'er and o'er,
Saved to serve for evermore.

2.
Serving God thro’all our days,
Toiling not for purse or praise;
But to magnify His name,
While the gospel we proclaim

3.
Seeking only souls to win
From the deadly power of sin;
We would guide their steps aright.
Out of darkness into light.

- El Nathan
