Does Jesus Care

1.
Does Jesus care when my heart is pained
Too deeply for mirth and song;
As you burdens press, and the cares distress,
And the way grows weary and long?

CHORUS
0 yes, He cares -I know He cares
His heart is touched with my grief;
When the days are weary, the long
nights dreary,I know my Saviour cares.

2.
Does Jesus care when my way is dark
With a name - less dread and fear?
As the day - light fades into deep night shades,
Does He care enough to be near?

2.
Does Jesus care when I've tried and failed
To resist some temptation strong;
When for my deep grief I find no relief,
Tho my tears flow all the night long?

3.
Does Jesus care when I've said goodbye
To the dearest on earth to me.
And my sad heart aches till it nearly breaks
Is it aught to Him?does He see?
