We Are Just Upon The Dawning

1.
We are just upon the dawning
Of that bright and glorious morning.
When the Bridegroom comes to call away His bride;
We’ll be then caught up to meet Him,
Hallelujah, what a greeting,
When the Bridegroom comes, and we’ll with Him abide.

CHORUS
Then we’ll shout Hallelujah and sing Hallelujah.
Glory, Hallelujah to our Lord,
We will bow down before Him.
worship and adore Him,
King of kings and Lord of lords.

2
.Get your lamps all trimmed and burning,
For the Bridegroom is returning,
And the cry, go forth to meet Him, soon will come
Be ye wise, make haste to meet Him
With your lamps lit, soon to greet Him,
As He comes in clouds descending for His own.

3.
At the mill, two will be grinding,
In field, two binding,
When the Bridegroom comes tocatch away
Only one then will be taken,
And the other one forsaken,
Watch, ye know not what the hour your Lord comes.
