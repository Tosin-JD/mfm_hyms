Truro - L. M.

1.
Now in a song of grateful praise,
To Thee O Lord, my voice I’ll raise;
With all Thy saints I’ll join to tell,
My Jesus hath done all things well.

2.
How sov’reign, wonderful, and free
Has been Thy love to sinful me!
Thou sav’dst me from the jaws of hell;
My Jesus hath done all things well.

3.
Since e’er my soul has known His love,
What mercies He has made me prove!
Mercies which do all praise excel!
My Jesus hath done all things well.

4.
And when to that bright world I rise,
And join the anthems of the skies,
Above the rest, this note shall swell,
My Jesus hath done all things well.

- Samuel Medley
