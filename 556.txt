Rachie-6.5.

1.
Tarry for the Spirit,
He shall come in show’rs,
Energising wholly
All your ransom’d pow'rs;
Signs shall follow service
In the Holy Ghost,
Then the Church of
Jesus Prove a mighty host.

CHORUS
On then Church of Jesus,
Claim your Pentecost;
God shall now baptise thee
In the Holy Ghost.

2.
“Rivers” is Thy promise,
This shall be our plea,
Less than this can never
Meet our cry for Thee;
Tired of lukewarm service.
And the loss it brings,
We would live entirely
For eternal things.

3.
When the Spirit cometh,
Loosened lips shall tell,
Of the wondrous blessing
Which upon them fell;
Life of Jesus springing,
Like a well within,
Hearts with loud hosannas,
Constantly shall ring.

4.
When with joy we follow
In Christ’s triumph train,
And our lives are flooded
With the Latter Rain;
Then the world around us
Shall the impact feel,
Of a Church with vision,
Fired with holy zeal.

5.
Then the Lord of glory
Shall be magnified,
He who trod the wine-press,
Fully satisfied;
Walking in the Spirit,
Condemnation o’er,
Blessed life of worship,
Now and evermore.

- E. C W. Boulton
