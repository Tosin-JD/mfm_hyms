O Christ, Whose Glory Fills Our Days - L.M.

1.
O Christ, whose glory fills our days,
Whose beauty shines from shore to shore;
Our gladdest songs on high we raise
To Thee whom earth and heavâ€™n adore.

2.
The glory Thou to us hast shown,
Thy name proclaimed by Thy word;
Thy majesty is surely known,
Thy praise among all people heard.

3.
The drooping spirit lives again,
The fainting heart regains its power,
The sick and lame, Thy promise claim
In this Thy great appointed hour.

4.
With what a wealth- of faith and hope
Thy word is grasped, the weak made strong;
We stretch our hands to touch Thy robe
And healed and blessed, Thy praise prolong.
