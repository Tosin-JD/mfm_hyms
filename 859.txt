Over the thorn and thistle

1.
Over the thorn and thistle,
Along the stony way,
From the Shepherd’s care to the desert
There wander’d a sheep one day;
And a voice fell sadly from far away:
“My sheep, how long wilt thou love to stray!”
“My sheep, how long wilt thou love to stray?”

2.
Over the thorn and thistle,
Along the stony way,
With feet that bled, the ShepherdTo where the wand'rer lay;
He had heard it crying from far away:
“Lord, bring me home to Thy flock, I pray!”
“Lord, bring me home to Thy flock, I pray!”

3.
“Over the thorn and thistle,
Along the stony way,
I have sought for thee, now trust Me;
I’ll bear thee home today
The wolf and lion flee far away
When on My shoulder My sheep I lay,
When on My shoulder My sheep I lay:”

4.
Instead of the thorn and thistle,
The myrtle bedecks the way
Where the Shepherd feeds, and
gently leads
The sheep He found that day;
And He leadeth others from far away
To rest in fields of a cloudless day.
To rest in fields of a cloudless day.
