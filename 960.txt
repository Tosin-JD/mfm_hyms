Faint, yet Pursuing

1.
“Faint, yet pursuing,” we press our way
Up to the glorious gates of day;
Following Him who has gone before,
Over the path to the brighter shore.

CHORUS
“Faint, yet pursuing, “from day to day,
Over the thorny and blood marked way;
Strengthen and keep us, O Saviour Friend,
Ever pursuing, unto life’s end!

2.
“Faint, yet pursuing, whate’er befall;
He who has died for us, died for ail:
So should they come as a mighty throng,
Bearing His banner aloft with song.
Knowing, when darkly are skies o’ercast,
Sorrow and sighing will end at last.

4.
“Faint, yet pursuing:" the eye afar
Sees through the darkness the Morning Star,
Shedding its ray for the weary feet,
Lighting the way to the golden street.

- Mrs. W. R. Griswold
