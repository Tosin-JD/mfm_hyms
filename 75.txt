1.
Come, my brethren, praise your Saviour,
Let your songs with rapture swell,
Throâ€™ His grace have ye found favour,
Who His boundless love can tell?
Sing His praises! Sing His praises.
For He hath done all things well.

2.
Louder yet, yea grander, greater,
As your gladsome hearts rejoice
In your Saviour, Lord, Creator,
Swell, O swell the trembling chords;
Wake the echoes! The echoes!
Louder than the ocean a roar.

3.
What! Ye tire? shame upon you!
Dare ye cease to sing His praise?
Shall the very stones provoke you?
Louder sing your wondrous lays,
Till creation, till creation
Owns His mighty power to save.

4.
Blessed Lord, we will adore Thee,
Praise Thee, bless Thee, shout and sing,
Till that day when we shall see Thee,
Crowning Thee, all glorious King;
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
How the courts of glory ring.
