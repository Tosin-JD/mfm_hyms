Shipston -8.7.8.7.

1.
God the Father of creation,
master of the realms sublime,
Lord of light and life's foundation:
We believe and trust in him.

2.
Christ who came from highest heaven,
God from God before all time,
Son for our redemption given:
We believe and trust in him.

3.
Spirit, God in us residing,
power of life and love supreme,
intercessor pleading, guiding:
We believe and trust in him.

4.
Trinity of adoration!
Earth responds to heavenâ€™s theme
One the church's acclamation:
We believe and trust in him!
