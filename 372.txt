I Need Thee every Hour – 6.4.6.4. with Refrain

1.
I need Thee ev’ry hour,
Most gracious Lord;
No tender voice like Thine
Can peace afford.

2.
I need Thee every hour,
Stay Thou nearby;
Temptations lose their power
When Thou art nigh.

3.
I need Thee every hour,
In joy or pain;
Come quickly and abide,
Or life is vain.

4.
I need Thee every hour,
Teach me Thy will;
And Thy rich promises
In me fulfil.

5.
I need Thee every hour,
Most Holy One;
Oh, make me Thine indeed,
Thou blessed Son!
