Do You Really Care

1.
I look around in the place that I live;
I see people with so much to give;
Yet are those who are dying to know
Just that somebody cares.
Do you really care? Do you know how to share
With people ev’ry where? Do you really care?

CHORUS
People grope in darkness, Searching for a way,
Don’t you know of someone You can help today?

2.
I see people just longing to know
What they can live for and where they can go;
We have the hope and the purpose to share,
But, do we really care?
Will you take the dare? Spread
Good News ev’rywhere?
The cross of Christ to bear? Do you really care?
