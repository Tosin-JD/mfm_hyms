Benediction - 8.7.8.7.8.7.

1.
Alleluia! Song of gladness,
Voice of everlasting joy:
Alleluia! Sound the sweetest
Heard among the choirs on high.
Hymning in God’s blissful mansion
Day and night incessantly.

2.
Alleluia! Church victorious,
Thou mayst lift the joyful strain.
Alleluia! Songs of triumph
Well befit the ransom’d train.
Faint and feeble are our praises
While in exile we remain.

3.
Alleluia! Songs of gladness
Suit not always souls forlorn.
Alleluia! Sounds of sadness
'Midst our joyful strains are borne;
For in this dark world of sorrow
We with tears our sins must mourn

4.
Praises with our prayers uniting,
Hear us. blessed Trinity;
Bring us to Thy blissful presence.
There the Paschal Lamb to see,
There to Thee our Alleluia
Singing everlasting.
