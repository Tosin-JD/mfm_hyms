St. Matthias -8.8.8.8.8.8.

1.

Father on high to whom we pray,
and lift our thankful heart above
for all your mercies day by day,
for gifts of heart and home and love:
protect them still beneath your carej
Lord, in your mercy, hear our prayer.


2.
O Christ who came as man to earth,
and chose in Egyptâ€™s land to bea
omeless child of alien birth,
an exile and a refugee:
for homeless people everywhere
Lord, in your mercy, hear our prayer.


3.
Spirit divine, whose work is done
in souls renewed and lives restored:
strive in our hearts to make us one,
one faith, one family, one Lord;
till at the last one home we share
Lord, in your mercy, hear our prayer.

- Timothy Dudley Smith
