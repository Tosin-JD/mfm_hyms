Have Faith In God

1.
Have faith in God when your pathway is lonely.
He sees and knows all the way you have trod;
Never alone are the least of Hischildren;
Have faith in God, have faith in God.

CHORUS
Have faith in God, He's on His throne;
Have faith in God, He watcheth o’er His own;
He cannot fail, He must prevail;
Have faith in God, have faith in God.

2.
Have faith in God when your prayers are unanswered,
Your earnest plea He will never forget;
Wait on the Lord, trust His Word and, be patient;
Have faith in God, He’ll answer yet.

3.
Have faith in God in your pain and your sorrow,
His heart is touched with your grief and despair;
Cast all your cares and your burdens upon Him,
And leave them there, oh, leave them there.

4.
Have faith in God though all else fail about you;
Have faith in God, He provides for His own;
He cannot fail though all kingdoms shall perish,
He rules, He reigns upon His throne.
