IRISH C M.

1.
For mercies, countless as the sands
Which daily I receive.
From Jesus, my Redeemer's hands
My soul, what canst thou give?

2.
Alas, from such a heart as mine
what can I bring Him forth?
My best is stain'd and dyed with sin
My all is nothing worth.

3.
Yet his acknowledgement I'll make
for all He has bestow'd
Salvation's sacred cup I'll take
I'll call upon my God

4 The best return for one like me,
So wretched and so poor,
Is from His gifts to draw a plea,
And ask Him still for more

3.
I cannot serve Him as 1 ought
No works have I to boast
Yet would I glory in the thought
That I shall owe Him most.

- John Newton
