1.
Saviour, like a shepherd lead us,
Much we need Thy tender care,
In Thy pleasant pastures feed us,
For our use Thy folds prepare:
Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus
Thou hast bought us, Thine we are;
Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus,
Thou hast bought us. Thine we are.

2.
We are Thine; do Thou befriend us,
Be the Guardian of our way;
Keep Thy flock, from sin defend us,
Seek us when we go astray:
Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus, Hear,
O hear us when we pray;
Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus,
Hear, O hear us when we pray.

3.
Thou hast promised to receive us.
Poor and sinful though we be;
Thou hast mercy to relieve us,
Grace to cleanse, and pow'r to free:
Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus,
Early let us turn to Thee;
Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus,
Early let us turn to Thee.

4.
Early let us seek Thy favor,
Early let us do Thy will;
Blessed Lord and only Savour,
With Thy love our bosoms fill:
Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus,
Thou hast loved us, love us still,
Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus,
Thou hast loved us, bve us still.
