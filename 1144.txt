Hope On - 8.7.

1.
Hope on, hope on, O troubled heart!
If doubts and fears o'er take thee,
Remember this the Lord hath said,
He ‘never will forsake thee.”
Then murmur not, still bear thy lot,
Nor yield to care or sorrow;
Be sure the clouds that frown today
Will break in smiles tomorrow.

2.
Hope on, hope on! tho’ dark and
deep
The shadows gather o’er thee;
Be not dismay’d: thy Saviour holds
The Lamp of Life before thee.
And if He will that thou today
Shouldst tread the vale of sorrow,
Be not afraid; but trust and wait
The sun will shine tomorrow.

3.
Hope on, hope on! go bravely forth,
Thro’ trial and temptation;
Directed by the Word of truth,
So full of consolation.
There is a calm for ev’ry storm;
A joy for ev'ry sorrow;
A night from which the soul shall
wake
To hail an endless morrow.
