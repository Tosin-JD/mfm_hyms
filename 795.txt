Gracious Spirit, Holy Ghost,
Taught by Thee, we covet most,
Of Thy gifts at Pentecost,Holy, heavenly love.

1.
Love is kind and suffers long,
Love is meek and thinks no wrong,
Love than death itself more strong;
Therefore give us love.

2.
Prophecy will fade away,
Melting in the light of day;
Love will ever with us stay;
Therefore give us love.

3.
Faith will vanish into sight;
Hope be emptied in delight;
Love in heaven will shine more bright;
Therefore give us love.

4.
Faith and hope and love we see,
Joining hand in hand, agree;
But the greatest of the three,
And the best, is love.

- C. Wordsworth
