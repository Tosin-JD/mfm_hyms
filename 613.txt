613
WE WILL WORK TILL JESUS COMES


1.
O land of rest, for thee I sigh!
When will the moment come
When I shall lay my armour by,
And dwell in peace at home?

CHORUS
We’ll work till Jesus comes,
We’ll work till Jesus comes;
We’ll work till Jesus comes,
And we’ll be gathered home.

2.
To Jesus Christ I fled for rest;
He bade me cease to roam,
And lean for succour on His breast
Till He conduct me home.

3.
I sought at once my Saviour’s side,
No more my steps shall roam;
With Him I’ll brave death’s chilling tide,
And reach my heavenly home.
