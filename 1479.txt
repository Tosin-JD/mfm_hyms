Hidden Peace

1.
I cannot tell thee whence it came,
This peace within my breast;
But this I know, there fills my soul
A strange and tranquil rest.

CHORUS
There's a deep, settled peace in my soul,
There's a deep, settled peace in my soul;
Though the billows of sin near me roll,
He abides, Christ abides.

2.
Beneath the toil and care of life,
This hidden stream flows on;
My weary soul no longer thirsts,
Nor am I sad and lone.

3.
I cannot tell the half of love,
Unfeigned, supreme, divine,
That caused my darkest in most self
With beams of hope to shine.

4.
I cannot tell thee why He chose
To suffer and to die;
But if I suffer here with Him,
Iâ€™ll reign with Him for aye.
