Quietude-6.5.6.5.

1.
Speak, Lord, in the stillness
While I wait on Thee;
Hushed my heart to listen
In expectancy.

2.
Speak, O blessed Master,
In this quiet hour;
Let me see Thy face, Lord,
Feel Thy touch of power.

3.
For the words Thou speakest,
They are life indeed;
Living Bread from heaven,
Now my spirit feed.

4.
Speak, Thy servant heareth!
Be not silent, Lord;
Waits my soul upon Thee
For the quickening word.

5.
Fill me with the knowledge
Of Thy glorious will
All Thine own good pleasure
In Thy child fulfil.
