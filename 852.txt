He Ransomed Me

1.
There’s a sweet and blessed story
Of the Christ who came from glory,
Just to rescue me from sin and misery;
He in loving kindness sought me,
And from sin and shame hath bro’t me,
Hallelujah! Jesus ransomed me.

CHORUS
Hallelujah, what a Saviour!
Who can take a poor lost sinner,
Lift him from the miry clay and set him free;
I will ever tell the stray,
Shouting Glory, glory, glory,
Hallelujah! Jesus ransomed me.

2.
From the depth of sin and sadness
To the heights of joy and gladness
Jesus lifted me, in mercy full and free;
With His precious blood He bo’t me,
When I knew Him not, He sought me,
And in love divine He ransomed me.

3.
From the throne of heavenly glory
0, the sweet and blessed story!
Jesus came to lift the lost in sin and woe
Into liberty all glorious,
Trophies of His grace victorious.
Evermore rejoicing here below.

4.
By and by with joy increasing,
And with gratitude unceasing.
Lifted up with Christ forever more to be;
I will join the hosts there singing,
In the anthem ever ringing,
To the King of Love who ransomed me.
