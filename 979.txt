Justification - L.M.

1.
Arm of the Lord, awake, awake!
Thine own immortal strength put on,
With terror clothed, hell's kingdom shake,
And cast Thy foes with fury down.

2.
As in the ancient days appear.
The sacred annals speak Thy fame
Be now omnipotently near.
To endless ages still the same.

3.
Thy arm, Lord, is not shortened now,
It wants not now the power to save;
Still present with Thy people. Thou
Bear’st them through life’s disparted wave.

4.
By death and hell pursued in vain,
To Thee the ransomed seed shall come;
Shouting, their heavenly Zion gain,
And pass through death triumphant home.

- Charles Wesley
