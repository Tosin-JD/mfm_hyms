LEAN ON HIS ARMS

1.
Just lean upon the arms of Jesus,
He’ll help you along, help you along,
If you will trust His love unfailing,
He’ll fill your heart with song.

CHORUS
Lean on His arms, trusting in His love;
Lean on His arms, all His mercies prove;
Lean on His arms, looking home above,
Just lean on the Saviour’s arms!

2.
Just lean upon the arms of Jesus,
He'll brighten the way, brighten the way:
Just follow gladly where He leadeth,
His gentle voice obey.

3.
Just lean upon the arms of Jesus,
Oh bring every care, bring every care!
The burden that has seemed so heavy,
Take to the Lord in prayer.

4.
Just lean upon the arms of Jesus,
Then leave all to Him, leave all to Urn
His heart is full of love and mercy,
His eye are never dim.

5.
Just lean upon the arms of Jesus,
He meets every need, meets every need.-
To all who take Him as a Saviour,
He is a Friend indeed.
