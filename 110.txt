Moseley-6.6.8.4.

1.
The star of morn has risen:
O Lord, to Thee we pray
O uncreated Light of Light,
Guide Thou our way.

2.
Sinless be tongue and hand,
And innocent the mind;
Let simple truth be on our lips,
Our hearts be kind.

3.
As the swift day rolls on,
Still, Lord, our guardian be;
And keep the portals of our hearts
From evil free.

4.
Grant that our daily toil
May to Thy glory tend;
And as our hours begin with Thee,
So may they end.
