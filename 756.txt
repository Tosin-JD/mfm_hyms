St. Magnus - C.M.

1.
Strong Captain, in thy holy ranks
We take our places now:
Give us the mood befitting those
Who make so great a vow.

2.
For foolishness it were to come
In hardihood of pride.
And cowardice it were to come
And wish to be untried.

3.
Weâ€™ll not mistrust our want o strength
Nor trust our strength of will;
Our only confidence, that thou
Believest in us still.

4.
Make, then, our task to match our strength
Our strength to match our task,
And make us unafraid to do
Whatever thou wilt ask.

- J. M. C. Crum
