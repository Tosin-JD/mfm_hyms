No, Not Despairingly - 6.4.6.4.6.6.4.

1.
No, not despairingly
Come I to Thee;
No, not distrustingly
Bend I the knee:
Sin hath gone over me,
Yetis this still my plea:
Yet is this still my plea:
Jesus hath died.

2.
Ah! Mine iniquity
Crimson has been
Infinite, infinite,
Sin upon sin;
Sin of not loving Thee,
Sin of not trusting Thee,
Sin of not trusting Thee,
Infinite sin.

3.
Lord, I confess to Thee
Sadly my sin;
All I am tell I Thee,
All I have been:
Purge Thou my sin away,
Wash Thou my soul this day;
Wash Thou my soul this day;
Lord, make me clean.

4.
Faithful and just art Thou,
Forgiving all;
Loving and kind art Thou
When poor ones call;
Lord, let the cleansing Blood,
Blood of the Lamb of God,
Blood of the Lamb of God,
Pass oâ€™er my soul.

5.
Then all is peace and light
This soul within;
Thus shall I walk with Thee,
The loved Unseen;
Leaning on Thee, my God,
Guided along the road,
Guided along the road,
Nothing between.
