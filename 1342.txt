Onward and upward - 6.5.6.5.D. and Refrain

1.
Onward, still, and upward. Follow" ever more
where our mighty Leader Goes in love before;
“Looking unto Jesus," Reach a helping hand,
To a struggling neighbour, Helping him to stand.

CHORUS
Marching onward, upward,
Marching steadily onward, Jesus leads the way,
Marching onward, upward,
Onward unto glory to the perfect day.

2.
Onward, ever onward, Thro’ the pastures green,
Where the streams flow softly Under skies serene;
Or, if need be, upward, O’er the rocky steep,
Trusting Him to guide us, Strong to save and keep.

3.
Upward, ever upward, T’ward the radiant glow,
Far above the valley, Where the mist hangs low;
On, with songs of gladness,
Till the march shall end.
Where ten thousand thousand
Hallelujahs blend.
