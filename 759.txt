Hanford -10.10.11.11. with Refrain

1.
More like the Master I would ever be,
More of His meekness, more humility;
More zeal to labour, more courage to be true,
More consecration for work He bids me do.

CHORUS
Take Thou my heart, I would be Thine alone;
Take Thou my heart and make it all Thine own;
Purge me from sin, O Lord, I now implore,
Wash me and keep me Thine forever more.

2.
More like the Master is my daily prayer;
More strength to carry crosses I
must bear;More earnest effort to bring His kingdom in;
More of His Spirit, the wanderer to win.

3.
More like the Master I would live and grow;
More of His love to others I would show;
More self denial, like His in Galilee,
More like the Master I long to ever be.

- Charles H. Gabriel
