Gerrans - 6.6.8.6.11.11.

1.
Awaked from sleep we fall
Before thee. God of love,
And chant the praise the angels raise,
O God of might, above:
Holy, Holy, Holy! Thou art God adored!
In thy pitying mercy show us mercy, Lord.

2.
As at thy call I rise,
Shine on this mind and heart,
And touch my tongue, that I among
Thy choir may take my part:
Holy, Holy, Holy! Trinity adored!
In thy pitying mercy show us mercy, Lord.

3.
The Judge will come with speed,
And each manâ€™s deeds be known;
Our trembling cry shall rise on high
At midnight to thy throne:
Holy, Holy, Holy! King of Saints adored!
In the hour of judgement show us mercy, Lord.
