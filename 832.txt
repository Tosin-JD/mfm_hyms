The Bond of Love

1.
We are one in the bond of love
We are one in the bond of love.
We have joined our spirit with theSpirit of God;
We are one in the bond of love.

2.
Let us sing now, evâ€™ry one;
Let us feel His love begun.
Let us join our hands, that the world will know
We are one in the bond of love.

- O. Skillings
