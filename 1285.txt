1.
Be present at our table. Lord,
Be here and everywhere adored;
Bless these Thy gifts and grant that we
May feast in Paradise with Thee.

2.
We thank Thee, Lord, for this our food,
For life, and health, and every good:
May manna to our souls be given,
The bread of life sent down from heaven.

- John Cennick (1741, alt.)
