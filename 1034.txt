WE HAVE AN ANCHOR

1.
Will your anchor hold in the storms of life.
When the clouds unfold their wings of strife?
When the strong tides lift, and the cables strain,
Will your anchor drift, or firm remain?

CHORUS
We have an anchor that keeps the soul
Steadfast and sure while the billows roll,
Fastened to the Rock which cannot move,
Grounded firm and deep in the
Saviour’s love

2.
It is safely moored ‘twill the storm withstand.
For ‘tis well secured by the
Saviour's hand;
Though the tempest rage and the
wild winds blow.
Not an angry wave shall our bark o’erflow.

3.
When our eyes beheld through thegathering night
The city of gold, our harbour bright,
We shall anchor fast by the
heavenly shore,
With the storms all past forever more.
