The Straying Sheep

1.
How many sheep are straying,
Lost from the Saviour’s fold!
Upon the lonely mountain
They shiver with the cold:
Within the tangled thickets,
Where poison vines do creep,
And over rocky ledges
Wander the poor, lost sheep.

CHORUS
O come, let us go and find them!
In the paths of death they roam.
At the close of the day 'twill be sweet to say;
‘I have brought some lost one home.’

2.
O who will go to find them?
Who, fdr the Saviour’s sake,
will search with tireless patience
Thro’ brier and thro’ brake?
Unheeding thirst or hunger,
Who still, Who still, from day to day,
Will seek, as for a treasure.
The sheep that go astray?

3.
Say, will you seek to. find them?
From pleasant bow’rs of ease
Will you go forth determin’d
To find the least of these?
For still the Saviour calls them.
And looks across the world,
And still He holds wide open
The door into His fold.

4.
How sweet ’twould be at evening
If you and I could say
’Good Shepherd, we’ve been seeking
The sheep that went astray!
Heart sore and faint with hunger.
We heard them making moan.
And lo! we come at night fall.
And bear them safely home.’
