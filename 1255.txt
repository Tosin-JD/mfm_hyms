1.
Jesus bids us shine With a clear, pure light,
Like a little candle Burning in the night;
In this world is darkness, So we must shine,
You in your small comer, And I in mine.

2.
Jesus bids us shine, First of all for Him;
Well He sees and knows it If our light is dim;
He looks down from heaven To see us shine,
You in your small corner, And I in mine.

3.
Jesus bids us shine, Then for all around,
Many kinds of darkness In this world abound
Sin and want and sorrow So we must shine,
You in your small corner, And I in mine.
