Crucified And Crowned - 7.7.

1.
Wearied in the strife of sin.
Foes without and fears within,
Listen, look, I hear, I see
Jesus, crucified for me.

2.
Listen, how He pleads “Forgive;”
Look, my soul, on Him and live:
All my guilt on Jesus laid,
Perfect reconcilement made.

3.
Counting all the world but loss,
Let me clasp the blood stain’d cross;
What can sinners crave beside
Jesus only, crucified?

4.
Resting in His love, forgiven,
Thoughts will come of home and
heaven
Listen, look, I hear, I see
Jesus crown’d, and crown’d for me

5.
Listen to His mighty prayer
He would have me with Him there
With the saints before His throne.
Clothed in glory like His own.

6.
Look, He reigns for ever now:
Many crowns are on His brow:
By His Father’s side adored
Priest and King and God and Lord.

7.
Yea, amen. Thy will be done,
All my prayers are breathed in one:
Jesus, let me rest in Thee,
Crucified and crowned for me.
