1377
Let the lower lights be burning

1.
Brightly beams our Father's mercy
From His light house ever more,
But to us He gives the keeping
Of the lights along the shore.

CHORUS
Let the lower lights be burning!
Send a gleam across the wave
Some poor fainting, struggling sea-man
You may rescue, you may save

2.
Dark the night of sin has settled,
Loud the angry billows roar;
Eager eyes are watching, longing,
For the lights along the shore.

3.
Trim your feeble lamp, my brother,
Some poor sailor tempest tossed,
Trying now to make the harbor,
In the darkness may be lost.
