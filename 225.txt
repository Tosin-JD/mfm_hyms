225
That means you

1.
Blessed invitation from the King of heav’n,
Blessed invitation by the spirit giv’n
Falling on the weary like refreshing dew,
“Whosoever believeth” that means you.

CHORUS
That means you, brother, that means you,
Trust the Saviour's promise tried and true;
That means you, brother, that means you;
"Whosoever believeth that you.

2.
Reconciliation thro' his precious blood,
He hath wrought salvation Blessed Son of God!
All the work is finished, there is naught to do,
But to claim the blessing; that means you.

3.
Saving all who trust him to the uttermost,
Boasting is excluded, yet In him we boast;
Soul, receive the message wonderful and true,
“Whosoe'er believeth’' that means you.

4.
Doubt His word no longer come to him today,
Turning from your sins for evermore away;
Thro' his boundless mercy all shall be forgiv’n;
He will safely guide you home to heav’n.

5.
There in realms of glory we will sing his praise.
With the shout of triumph, thro eternal days
For the invitation old yet ever new.
Glory, hallelujah! that means you.
