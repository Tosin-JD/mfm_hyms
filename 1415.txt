Mansions Over The Hiitop

1.
I'm satisfied with just a cottage below,
A little silver and a little gold;
But in that city where the ransomed will shine,
I want a gold one that’s silver lined.

CHORUS
I’ve got a mansion just over the hiltop.
In that bright land where we’ll never grow old,
And someday yonder we will never more wander
But walk on streets that are purest gold.

2.
Tho often tempted, tormented and tested
And like the prophet, my pillow a stone;
And tho I find here no permanent dwelling,
I know He'll give me a mansion my own.

3.
Don’t think me poor or deserted or lonely,
I’m not discouraged, I’m Heaven bound;
I’m just a pilgrim in search of a city,
I want a mansion, a harp and a crown.
