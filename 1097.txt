All Your Anxiety - Irregular

1.
Is there a heart o’er bound by sorrow?
Is there a life weighed down by care?
Come to the cross each burden bearing,
All your anxiety leave it there.

CHORUS
All your anxiety, all your care,
Bring to the mercy seat leave it there;
Never a burden He cannot bear,
Never a friend like Jesus!

2.
No other friend so keen to help you.
No other friend so quick to hear;
No other place to leave your burden,
No other one to hear your prayer.

3.
Come then at once delay no longer!
Heed His entreaty kind and sweet;
You need not fear a disappointment
You shall find peace at the mercy seat.

- Edward Henry Joy
