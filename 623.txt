THE CHURCH HAS WAITED LONG


1.
The Church has waited long
Her absent Lord to see;
And still in loneliness she waits,
A friendless stranger she.
Age after age has gone,
Sun after sun has set;
And still, of her dear Lord bereft,
Come then, Lord Jesus come.

2.
Saint after saint on earth
Has lived, and loved, and died;
And as they left us one by one,
We laid them side by side.
We laid them down to sleep,
But not in hope forlorn:
We laid them but to slumber there
Till the last glorious morn,
Come then, Lord Jesus,'come.

3.
The serpent's brood increase,
The powers of hell grow bold;
The conflict thickens, faith is low.
And love is waxing cold.
How long, O Lord our God.
Holy, and true, and good,
Wilt Thou not judge Thy suffering church,
Her sighs, and tears, and blood?
Come then, Lord Jesus, come.

4.
We long to hear Thy voice,
To see Thee face to face,
To share Thy crown and glory then,
As now we share Thy grace.
Come, Lord, and wipe away
The curse, the sin, the strain;
And make this blighted world of ours
Thine own fair world again;
Come then, Lord Jesus, come.
