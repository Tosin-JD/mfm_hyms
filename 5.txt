1.
God is in His temple
The Almighty Father;
Round His footstool let us gather:
Him with adoration
Serve, the Lord most holy,
Who hath mercy on the lowly;
Let us raise
Hymns of praise
For His great salvation:
God is in His temple

2.
Christ comes to His temple:
We, His word receiving,
Are made happy in believing;
Lo! from sin delivered,
He hath turned our sadness,
Our deep gloom, to light and gladness;
Let us raise
Hymns of praise,
For our bonds are severed:
Christ comes to His temple

3.
Come and claim Thy temple
Gracious Holy Spirit,
In our hearts, Thy home inherit;
Make in us Thy dwelling,
Thy high work fulfilling,
Into ours Thy will instilling;
Till we raise
Hymns of praise,
Beyond mortal telling,
In the eternal temple.

- William Tidd Matson
