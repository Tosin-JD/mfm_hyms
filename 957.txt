All the World for Jesus!

1.
Take up the battle cry all along the line,
Victory by and by, victory divine;
With your Commander nigh, foes in vain combine,
Raise aloft the banner, let it bear the sign;

CHORUS
All the world for Jesus! Let the chorus ring;
All the world for Jesus! frown Him King:
All the world for Jesus! Let the watchword be
Forward go in Jesus’ name to victory.

2.
Truth’s armour you may claim, faith will be your shield,
Fighting on in Jesus’ Name, mighty pow’r you wield;
Glory for God your aim, naught can make you yield,
Shout aloud the triumph, sure to be reveal'd.

3.
Soldiers, with courage go, go forsaking all,
Onward, then, to meet the foe, soon the foe shall fall;
Send mighty blow on blow, let no fear appall,
In the Name of Jesus sound afar the call.

- F. A. Breck
