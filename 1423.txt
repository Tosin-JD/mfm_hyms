I’ll Never Be Lonely Again

1.
Here I walk a rocky road.
And I tote a heavy load.
And so often I get weary and complain;
But when I get up there.
I will never have a care
And I’ll never be lonely again.

CHORUS
No, I’ll never be lonely again.
No, I’ll never be lonely again,
For I’ll be so free from the things that worry me.
And I'll never be lonely again.

2.
Here sometimes I feel alone,
And I miss the ones who've gone,
As down here for just a while I still remain;
But sometimes after a while
I’ll look back and only smile,
And I’ll never be lonely again.

3.
In that country over there,
I will never know a care,
And no one shall there grow hungry or be cold;
There'll be no briny tears,
and they’ll count not time by years,
And no one there shall ever grow old.
