277
The Saviour Is Waiting

1.
The Saviour is waiting to enter your heart;
Why don’t you let Him come in?
There’s nothing in this world to keep you apart,
What is your answer to Him?

CHORUS
Time after time, He has waited before,
And now He is waiting again.
To see if you're willing to open the door,
Oh, how He wants to come in.

2.
If you’ll take one step t'ward the Saviour, my friend;
You’ll find His arms open wide.
Receive Him and all of your darkness will end,
Within your heart He’ll abide.
