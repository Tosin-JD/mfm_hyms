Hymnus Eucharisticus - L.M.

1.
O love of God, how strong and true.
Eternal, and yet ever new,
Uncomprehended and unbought.
Beyond all knowledge and all thought!

2.
O heavenly love, how precious still.
In days of weariness and ill,
In nights of pain and helplessness.
To heal, to comfort, and to bless!

3.
O wide embracing, wondrous love,
We read thee in the sky above;
We read thee in the earth below,
In seas that swell and streams that flow.

4.
We read thee in the flowers, the trees,
The freshness of the fragrant breeze,
The songs of birds upon the wing,
The joy of summer and of spring.

5.
We read thee best in him who came
And bore for us the cross of shame.
Sent by the Father from on high,
Our life to live, our death to die.

6.
O love of God, our shield and stay
Through all the perils of our way;
Eternal love, in thee we rest,
For ever safe, for ever blest.

- H. Bonar
