Casting all your Care upon Him - C.M.

1.
How sweet, my Saviour, to repose
On Thine almighty power!
To feel Thy strength upholding me,
Thro’ ev’ry trying hour! 

CHORUS
"Casting all your cares upon Him,
Casting all your cares upon Him,
Casting all your cares upon Him,
for He careth, He careth for you.”

2.
It is Thy will that I should cast
My ev’ry care on Thee;
To Thee refer each rising grief,
Each new perplexity;

3.
That I should trust Thy loving care.
And look to Thee alone,
To calm each troubled thought to rest,
In prayer before Thy throne.

4.
Why should my heart then be distrest,
By dread of future ill?
Or why should unbelieving fear
My trembling spirit fill?

- Caesar Malan. D. D.
