L.M. and Refrain

1.
O happy day, that fixed my choice.
On Thee, my Saviour and my God!
Well may this glowing heart rejoice,
And tell its raptures all abroad.

CHORUS
Happy day, happy day,
When Jesus wash’d my sins away!
He taught me how to watch and pray,
And live rejoicing ev’ry day.

2.
‘Tis done, the great transaction’sdone!
I am my Lord’s and He is mine;
He drew me and I followed on,
Charmed to confess the voice divine.

3.
Now rest, my long-divided heart.
Fixed on this blissful centre, rest:
Nor ever from thy Lord depart,
With Him of every good possessed.

4.
High heaven, that heard the solemn vow,
That vow renewed shall daily hear,
Till in life’s latest hour I bow,
And bless in death a bond so dear.

- P. Doddridge
