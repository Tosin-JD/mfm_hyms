Isn’t the Love of Jesus Something Wonderful

1.
There will never be a sweeter story
Story of the Saviour’s love divine,
Love that bro’t Him from the realms of glory
Just to save a sinful soul like mine.

CHORUS
Isn’t the love of Jesus something
wonderful, wonderful, wonderful;
O isn't the love of Jesus something
wonderful! Wonderful it is to me.

2.
Boundless as the universe around me,
Reaching to the farthest soul away
Saving, keeping love it was that found me,
That is why my heart can truly say:

3.
Love beyond all human comprehending,
Love of God in Christ, how can it be!
This will be my theme and never ending,
Grace redeeming love of Calvary.
