1.
Blow, pentecostal breeze,
Breathe apostolic blast,
Stir pentecostal hearts at ease,
And sinners slumb’ring fast!

2.
Breathe, Holy Ghost today,
Dispel the ancient sloth;
The guilty deadness sweep away
In resurrection growth.

3.
Make sweeter graces bloom,
And lovelier virtues shine,
And mightier influences perfume
A world by purchase thine.

4.
Revive the ancient glow,
The fierce prophetic fire,
The ancient miracle bestow,
The former power inspire.

5.
Breathe on this soul of ours,
On branch and stem and root,
Till Christ shall smell His fragrant 1flowers
And taste His ripened fruit.

6.
Breathe on us, Mighty Breath,
On leaf and naked clod,
Breathe o’er the church’s creeping
deathThe pulsing life of God.

7.
Breathe till the perfume flows
O’er wastes where sins abound,
Till Calvary’s gospel incense blows
The stricken world around.

- Harold Horton
