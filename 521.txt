Ephraim-7.7.7.7.

1.
Clap your hands, ye people all,
Praise the God on whom ye call;
Lift your voice, and shout His praise,
Triumph is His sov’reign grace!

2.
Glorious is the Lord most High,
Terrible in majesty;
He His sovereign sway maintains,
King o’er all the earth He reigns.

3.
Jesus is gone up on high.
Takes His seat above the sky:
Shout the angel-choirs aloud,
Echoing to the trump of God.

4.
Sons of earth, the triumph join,
Praise Him with the host divine;
Emulate the heavenly powers,
Their victorious Lord is ours.

5.
Shout the God enthroned above,
Trumpet forth His conquering love;
Praises to our Jesus sing,
Praises to our glorious King!

6.
Power is all to Jesus given,
Power o’er hell, and earth, and heaven!
Power He now to us imparts;
Praise Him with believing hearts.

7.
Wonderful in saving power,
Him let all our hearts adore;
Earth and heaven repeat the cry,
“Glory be to God most High!”
