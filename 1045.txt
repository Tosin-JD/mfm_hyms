1045
Surely Goodness and Mercy

1.
A pilgrim was I, and a wand’ring,
In the cold night of sin I did roam,
When Jesus the kind Shepherd found me,
And now I am on my way home.

CHORUS
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me
All the days, all the days of my life;
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me
All the days, all the days of my life.

2.
He restoreth my soul when I’m weary,
He giveth me strength day by day;
He leads me beside the still waters,
He guards me each step of the way.

3.
When I walk thru the dark lone some valley,
My Saviour will walk with me there;
And safely His great hand will lead me
To the mansions He’s gone to prepare.

- John W. Peterson & Alfred B. Smith
