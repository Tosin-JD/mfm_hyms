Morecambe -10.10.10.10.

1.
Spirit of God, descend upon my heart;
Wean it from earth, thro’ all its pulses move.
Stoop to my weakness, mighty as Thou art,
And make me love Thee as I ought to love.

2.
Hast Thou not bid us love Thee, God and King?
All, all Thine own soul, heart and strength and mind.
I see Thy cross there teach my heart to cling;
O let me seek Thee, and O let me find.

3.
Teach me to feel that Thou art always nigh;
Teach me the struggles of the soul to bear
To check the rising doubt, the rebel sigh;
Teach me the patience of unanswered prayer.

4.
Teach me to love Thee as Thine angels love,
One holy passion filling all my frame:
The baptism of the heav’n descended Dove
My heart an altar and Thy love the flame.
