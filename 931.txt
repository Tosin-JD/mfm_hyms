931
When the Battle’s Over

1.
Am I a soldier of the cross?
A foll’wer of the Lamb?
And shall I fear to own His cause
Or blush to speak His name?

CHORUS
And when the battle’s over
we shall wear a crown!
Yes, we shall wear a crown!
Yes we shall wear a crown!
And when the battle’s over
we shall wear a crown
In the new Jerusalem.
Wear a crown, wear a crown,
Wear a bright and shining crown;
And when the battle's over
we shall wear a crown
In the new Jerusalem.

2.
Must I be carried to the skies
On flow'ry beds of ease,
While others fought to win the prize
And sailed thru bloody seas?

3.
Are there no foes for me to face?
Must I not stem the flood?
Is this vile world a friend to grace,
To help me on to God?

4.
Sure I must fight if I would reign
Increase my courage, Lord!
I'll bear the toil, endure the pain,
Supported by Thy Word.

- Issac Watts, D. D.
