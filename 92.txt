Christ Is My Portion For Ever - 8.7.8.7. with Ref

1.
Christ is my portion for ever,
He is my Saviour from sin;
He is my blessed salvation
I have the witness within

CHORUS
I have the witness within
Jesus now saves me from sin
In His heart Iâ€™ve place,
I am saved by His grace
And I have the witness within.

2.
He is my fortress and tower,
He is my guide and my King;
He is my Shepherd, my Keeper,
Joyfully now I can sing.

3.
Praise to the One who redeems me,
Praise to my Crucified Lord,
Now I am saved, Hallelujah,
Praise for the wonderful word.
