Oh, where do you journey, my brother?
Oh, where do you journey, I pray?
Oh, where do you journey, my sister,
And when we get safely to Glory,
Oh, say. shall we meet you all there?

CHORUS
Oh, say, shall we meet you all there?
Oh, say, shall we meet you all there?
And when we get safely to Glory,
Oh, say, shall we meet you all there?

2.
Oh, what is your mission, my brother?
Oh. what is your mission below?
Oh, what is your mission, my sister.
As journeying onward you go?
Our mission is practising mercy,
Sweet charity, patience, and love,
And following the footsteps of Jesus,.
That lead to the mansions above. yob?'

3.
Oh, yes, you will meet us, my brother,
God helping our weakness and sin;
And bearing the Cross, we, my sister,
The crown will endeavour to win.
We’ll walk through the vale and the shadow,
Through sufferings and trials and care,
And when you get safely to Glory,
You’ll meet us, you’ll meet us all there.
