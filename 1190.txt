Come for the Feast is Spread

1.
Come for the feast is spread:
Hark to the call!
Come to the Living Bread,
Broken for all:
Come to his "house of win/
Low on His breast recline,
All that He hath make thine;
Come sinner, come.

2.
Come where the fountain flows-
River of life -
Healing for all thy woes,
Doubting and strife;
Millions have been supplied,
No one was e'er denied;
Come to the crimson tide,
Come, sinner come.

3.
Come to the throne of grace,
Boldly draw near;
He who would win the race;
Must tarry here;
Whateâ€™er thy want may be
Here is the grace for thee.
Jesus Thy only plea:
Come, Christian, Come.

4.
Jesus, we come to Thee,
Oh, take us in!
Set Thou our spirits free;
Cleanse us from sin!
Then, in your land of light,
All clothed in robes of white,
Resting not day nor night.
Thee will we sing.

- Henry Burton (1878)
