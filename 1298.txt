Melcombe - 8.8.8.8.(L.M.)

1.
We give God thanks for those who knew
the touch of Jesus’ healing love;
they trusted him to make them whole,
to give them peace, their guilt remove.

2.
We offer prayer for all who go
relying on his grace and power,
to help the anxious and the ill,
to heal their wounds, their lives restore.

3.
We dedicate our skills and time
to those who suffer where we live,
to bring such comfort as we can
to meet their need, their pain relieve.

4.
So Jesus’ touch of healing grace
lives on within our willing care,
by thought and prayer and gift weprove
his mercy still, his love we share.
