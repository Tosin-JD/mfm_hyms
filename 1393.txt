1.
Head of the church triumphant,
We joyfully adore Thee;
Till Thou appear. Thy members
hereShall sing ike those :n glory:
We lift bur hearts and voices,
With bless’ed anticipation,
And cry aloud, and give to God
The praise of our salvation.

2.
While in aflliction’s furnance.
And passing through the fire.
Thy love we praise in grateful lays
Which ever brings us nigher:
We clap our hands, exulting
In Thine almighty favour:
The love divine, that made us Thine.
Shall keep us Thine 'or ever.

3.
Thou dost conduct Thy people
Through torrents of temptation:
Nor will we fear, while Thou art near
The fire of tribulation;'
The world, with sin and Satan,
In vain our march opposes,
By Thee we shall break through them all,
And sing the song of Moses.

4.
By faith we see the glory
To which Thou shalt restore us,
The world despise, for that high prize
Which Thou hast set before us:
And, if Thou count us worthy,
We each, with dying Stephen,
Shall see Thee stand at God’s right hand
To call us up to heaven.
