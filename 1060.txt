Someone To Care

1.
When the world seems cold and your friends seem few.
There is someone who cares for you;
When you’ve tears in your eyes,
your heart bleeds inside,
There is someone who cares for you.

CHORUS
Someone to care, Someone to share
all your troubles like no other can do;
He’ll come down from the skies
and brush the tears from your eyes.
You’re His child and He cares for you.

2.
When your disappointments come
and you feel so blue,
There is someone who cares for you;
When you need a friend, a friend till the end.
There is someone who’s a friend to you.
