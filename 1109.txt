Never Alone

1.
I’ve seen the lightning flashing
And heard the thunder roll,
I’ve felt sin’s breakers dashing,
Which tried to conquer my soul;
I’ve heard the voice of my Saviour,
He bid me still fight on
He promised never to leave me,
Never to leave me alone.

CHORUS
No, never alone, No, never alone
He promised never to leave me,
Never to leave me alone;
No, never alone, No, never alone
He promised never to leave me,
Never to leave me alone.

2.
The world’s fierce winds are
blowing
Temptation’s sharp and keen;
I have a peace in knowing
My Saviour stands between;
He stands to shield me from danger
When all my friends are gone
He promised never to leave me,
Never to leave me alone.

3.
When in affliction’s valley
I tread the road of care.
My Saviour helps me carry
The cross so heavy to bear;
Tho all around me is darkness
And earthly joys are flown,
My Saviour whispers His promise
Never to leave me alone.

4.
He died on Calv’ry’s mountain,
For me they pierced His side,
For me He opened that fountain.
The crimson, cleansing tide;
For me He’s waiting in glory
Upon His heav'nly throne
He promised never to leave me,
Never to leave me alone.
