Gott Willâ€™s Machen - 8.7.8.7.

1.
Father, hear the prayer we offer
not for ease our prayer shall be,
but for strength that we may ever
live our lives courageously.

2.
Not for ever n green pastures
do we ask our way to be;
but the steep and rugged pathway
may we tread rejoicingly.

3.
Not for ever by still waters
would we idly rest and stay;
but would strike the living fountains
from the rocks along our way.

4.
Be our strength in hours of weakness,
in our wanderings be out guide;
through endeavour, failure, danger,
Father, be there at our side.

- Love M. Wills
