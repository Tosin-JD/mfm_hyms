Orientis Partibus - 7.7.7.7.4.

1.
Love’s redeeming work is done;
Fought the fight, the battle won:
Lo, our Sun's eclipse is o’er!
Lo, He sets in blood no more!
Hallelujah!

2.
Vain the stone, the watch, the seal!
Christ has burst the gates of hell;
Death in vain forbid His rise;
Christ has opened Paradise.
Hallelujah!

3.
Lives again our glorious King;
Where, O death, is now thy sting?
Dying once, He all doth save;
Where thy victory, O grave?
Hallelujah!

4.
Soar we now where Christ has led,
Following our exalted Head;
Made like Him, like Him we rise;
Ours the cross, the grave, the skies.
Hallelujah!

5.
Hail the Lord of earth and heaven!
Praise to Thee by both be given:
Thee we greet triumphant now;
Hail, the Resurrection Thou!
Hallelujah!

- Charles Wesley
