Since Jesus passed by

1.
Like the blind man I wandered,
So lost and undone,
A beggar so helpless,
Without God or His Son;
Then my Saviour in mercy,
heard and answered my cry and Oh,
what a difference since Jesus passed by!

CHORUS
Since Jesus passed by, 
Since Jesus passed by,
Oh, what a difference since Jesus passed by!
Well, I can’t explain it, 
and I cannot tell you why,
but Oh, what a difference, since Jesus passed by!

2.
All my yesterdays are buried
in the deepest of the sea;
That old load of guilt I carried,
is all gone, Praise God, I’m free!
Looking for that bright tomorrow,
where no tears will dim the eye
Well, Oh, what a difference since Jesus passed by!

- William J. Gaither

1.
All that drew me I have left behind.
Here in Canaan better joys I find;
Peace abiding, blessings unconfined.
For I’m living in Canaan now.

CHORUS
I am living in Canaan now,
Where the showers of blessing abound;
Where the riches of grace in plenty are found,
I am living in Canaan now.

2.
Safe abiding I will never fear,
For my Saviour ever will be near
When I call Him He will always bear,
For I’m living in Canaan now.

3.
I am drinking from a ceaseless well,
Here in Canaan where I love to dwell,
So to others I am glad to tell,
That I’m living in Canaan now.

4.
Praises ever I am glad to bring
Unto Jesus, my Redeemer, King;
For His mercies I will shout and sing,
For I’m living in Canaan now.
