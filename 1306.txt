1.
Jesus is the same for ever,
As of old, so now today;
All the hosts of hell endeavour
Vainly to obstruct His sway.
In His people’s hearts He reigneth.
Finishes what He begins;
Jesus still “all power” retaineth.
Saves His people from their sins.

2.
Jesus is the same for ever;
Yes, He heals the sick today.
As of old, so now, He ever
Turns one suffering child away,
He can cure the worst diseases,
For He understands our frame;
Bore our griefs, and so releases
All who dare their rights to claim.

3.
Jesus is the same for ever;
Still He says “In Me abide."
From His love no power can sever
Those who in their Lord confide
Sweetly from all care He frees us,
Ours the comfort His the shame.
Blessed Saviour; precious Jesus!
There’s no music like Thy name.
