Otannenbaum -8.8.8.8.8.8.8.7.

1.
A messenger named Gabriel
came to the land of Israel;
and he proclaimed that Mary’s son
was God's messiah, holy One.

CHORUS
O Jesus Christ, strong Son of God,
once born for us at Bethlehem:
we listen to the angel’s song
and worship you for ever.

2.
Angelic hosts of God most high
with radiant glory fill the sky;
enraptured voices joyful sing
to welcome Christ, the new born King.
O Jesus Christ.

3.
In awesome fear and bitter cold
the shepherds huddle in their fold;
then since the message is for them
they make their way to Bethlehem.
O Jesus Christ..

4.
Within the sacred stable shrine
they see the holy child divine;
the manger stands amidst the straw
and humble fold their God adore.
O Jesus Christ.

5.
Since then have passed two thousand years
of human misery and tears;
yet Christ alone can bring release:
he loves us still - the prince of peace.
O Jesus Christ.
