After A Few More Years - 7.7.D

1.
After a few more years
After a few more times
We shall be gathered with all those
Who are slept in the tomb

CHORUS
Jesus my Lord and God
Help me prepare for Thee,
Wash Thou me in Thy precious blood
And take my sins away.

2.
After a few more days
Spent in this wicked world
We’ll reach the land where there’s no sun
A land of fadeless day,

3.
After a few more storms
On this wave bitten shore
We’ll leave the stormy seas and
reach
A shore that’s ever calm

4.
After a tew troubles
After partings are done,
After our sad and bitter tears,
There will be no more tears.

5.
A few more days of rest,
Is all we have on earth
We shall get to a place of rest
Where it shall never end.

6.
A few more days to wait,
And He, Christ shall return
The One who died that we may live
And reign with Him forever.
