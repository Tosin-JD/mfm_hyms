I’m Living In His Love

1.
He did not come to spare all the woes of life,
Or bear me upon flow’ry of ease.
He does not shield my ears from cries of pain and strife,
Nor hide my eyes from scenes that may displease.
But sure am I His pow’r has form'd this world I see,
And stronger still His mighty love for me;
So without fear I’m living in that love each day,
My God will take me thru the
storms, let come what may.

2.
I cannot tell what lies beyond the towring range,
Or what the distant valley holds for me.
My path ways lead throgh lands
and waters cold and strange,
Tomorrow comes, but has no guarantee.
But sure am I His pow’r has fom’d this world I see,
And stronger still His saving grace for me;
So without fear I’m living in God’s love each day.
My God will take me thru the storms,let come what may.
