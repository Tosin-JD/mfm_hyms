Come, Great Deliverer, Come

1.
Oh, hear my cry, be gracious now to me.
Come, Great Deliv’rer, come!
My soul bowed down is longing now for Thee.
Come, Great Deliv’rer come!

CHORUS
I’ve Wandered far away o'er
mountains cold,
I've wandered far away from home;
Oh, take me now, and bring me toThy fold!
Come, Great Deliv’rer, come!

2.
I have no place, no shelter from the night,
Come, Great Deliv’rer, come!
One look from Thee would give me life and light.
Come, Great Deliverer, come!

3.
My path is lone, and weary are my feet,
Come, Great Deliverer, come!
Mine eyes look up Thy loving smile to meet,
Come, Great Deliverer, come!

4.
Thou wilt not spurn contrition’s broken sigh,
Come, Great Deliverer, acme!
Regard my prayer, and hear my humble cry,
Come, Great Deliverer, come!
