HEAVENLY SUNLIGHT

1.
Walking in sunlight all of my journey,
Over the mountains, thru the deep vale;
Jesus has said, "I'lll never for sake thee,”
Promise divine that never can fail.

CHORUS
Heavenly sunlight,heavenly sunlight
Flooding my soul with glory divine;

2.
Shadows around me, shadows above me,
Never conceal my Saviour and Guide;
He is the Light, in Him is no darkness
Ever I’m walking close to His side.

3.
In the bright sunlight, ever rejoicing,
Pressing my way to mansions above;
Singing His praises, gladly I’m walking
Walking in sunlight, sunlight of love.

- Henry J. Zelley
