The Blood of My Redeemer

1.
I will praise the Lord for His love to me,
I am wash’d in the blood of my Redeemer,
In the fount that flows at the cross so free,
I am wash’d in the blood of my Redeemer.

CHORUS
Glory, glory, glory to the Lamb,
I am sav’d from sin and He makes me what I am;
Oh, glory, glory, glory to the Lamb,
I am wash’d in the blood of my Redeemer.

2.
I am saved by grace and to Him bro't near,
I am wash’d in the blood of my Redeemer,
I would sing so loud that the world might hear,
I am wash’d in the blood of my Redeemer.

3.
What a constant peace in my heart I feel,
I am wash’d in the blood of my Redeemer,
There’s holy joy I can ne’er reveal,
I am wash’d in the blood of my Redeemer.

4.
I will lift my voice while on earth I
stay,I am wash’d in the blood of my Redeemer,
Then my soul shall sing in the realms of day,
I am wash’d in the blood of my Redeemer.
