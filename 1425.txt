The Last Mile Of The Way

1.
If I walk in the pathway of duty.
If I work till the close of the day;
I shall see the great King in His beauty,
When I’ve gone the last mile of the way.

CHORUS
When I’ve gone the last mile of the way,
I will rest at the close of the day,
And I know there are joys that await me,
When I’ve gone the last mile of the way.

2.
If for Christ I proclaim the glad story,
If I seek for His sheep gone astray,
I am sure He will show me His glory.
When I’ve gone the last mile of the way.

2.
Here the dearest of ties we must sever,
Tears of sorrow are seen ev’ry day;
But no sickness, no sighing for ever
When I’ve gone the last mile of the way.

3.
And if here I have earnestly striven.
And have tried all His will to obey.
Twill enhance all the rapture of
heaven,When I’ve gone the last mile of the way.

- Rev. Johnson Oatman, Jr
