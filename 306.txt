I hear Thy Welcome Voice - S. M. with Refrain

1.
I hear Thy welcome voice,
That calls me, Lord, to Thee,
For cleansing in Thy precious blood
That flowed on Calvary.

CHORUS
I am coming, Lord!
Coming now to Thee!
Trusting only in the blood
That flowed on Calvary.

2.
Tho' coming weak and vile,
Thou dost my strength assure;
Thou dost my vileness fully cleanse,
Till spotless all and pure.

3.
Tis Jesus calls me on
To perfect faith and love,
To perfect hope, and peace, and trust,
For earth and heavens above.

4.
Tis Jesus who confirms
The blessed work within,
By adding grace to welcomed grace.
Where reigned the power of sin.

5.
And He the witness gives
To loyal hearts and free,
That every promise is fulfilled,
If faith but brings the plea.

6.
All hail, atoning blood!
All hail, redeeming grace!
All hail, the gift of Christ, our Lord,
Our strength and righteiousness!
