In Memoriam - 8.6.7.6.7.6.7.6.

1.
There’s a song for all the children
that makes the heavens ring,
a song that even angels
can never, never sing;
they praise him as their maker
and see him glorified,
but we can call him Saviour
because for us he died.

2.
There’s a place for all the children
where Jesus reigns in love,
a place of joy and freedom
that nothing can remove;
a home that is more friendly
than any home we know,
where Jesus makes us welcome
because he loves us so.

3.
There’s a friend for all the children
to guide us every day,
whose care is always faithful
and never fades away:
there’s no one else so loyal
his friendship stays the same:
he knows us and he loves us,
and Jesus is his name.
