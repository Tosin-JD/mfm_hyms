1.
How, sure the Scriptures are!
God’s vital, urgent word,
as true as steel, and far
more sharp than any sword:
So deep and fine,
at his control
they pierce where soul
and spirit join.

2.
They test each human thought,
refining like a fire;
they measure what we ought
to do and to desire;
For God knows all
exposed it lies
before his eyes
to whom we call.

3.
Let those who hear his voice
confronting them today,
reject the tempting choice
of doubting or delay:
For God speaks still
his word is clear,
so let us hear
and do his will!
