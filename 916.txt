Jesus Saves

1.
We have heard the joyful sound
Jesus saves! Jesus saves!
Spread the tidings all around
Jesus saves! Jesus saves!
Bear the news to ev’ry land,
Climb the steeps and cross the waves;
Onward! ‘tis our Lord’s command
Jesus saves! Jesus saves!

2.
Waft it on |he rolling tide
Jesus saves! Jesus saves!
Tell to sinners far and wide
Jesus saves! Jesus saves!
Sing, ye islands of the sea!
Echo back, ye ocean waves!
Earth shall keep her jubilee
Jesus saves! Jesus saves!

3.
Sing above the battle strife
Jesus Saves! Jesus saves!
By-His death and endless life
Jesus saves! Jesus saves!
Sing it softly thru the gloom,
When the heart for mercy craves;
Sing in triumph o'er the tomb
Jesus saves! Jesus saves!

4.
Give the winds a mighty voice
Jesus saves! Jesus saves!
Let the nations now rejoice
Jesus saves! Jesus saves!
Shout salvation full and free,
Highest hills and deepest caves,
This our song of victory
Jesus saves! Jesus saves!
