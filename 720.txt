Yanworth -10.10.10.10.

1.
'Lift up your hearts!’We lift them to the Lord,
and give to God our thanks with one accord;
it is our joy and duty, all our days
to lift our hearts in grateful thanks and praise.

2.
Above the level of the former years,
the mire of sin, the slough of guilty fears,
the mist of doubt, the blight of love’s decay
O Lord of light, lift all our hearts today!

3.
Above the swamps of subterfuge and shame,
the halting tongue that dares not tell the whole
O Lord of truth, lift every Christian soul!
the deeds, the thoughts, that honour may not name,

4.
Above the storms that darken human life
pride, jealousy and envy, rage and strife;
where cold mistrust holds friend and friend apart
O Lord of love, lift every Christian heart!

5.
Then, with the trumpet call as Christ appears,
‘Lift up your hearts!’ rings, pealing in our ears;
still shall our hearts respond with full accord
‘We lift them up, we lift them to the Lord!’
