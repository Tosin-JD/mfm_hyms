I Want, Dear Lord, A Heart

1.
I want, dear Lord, a heart That’s true and clean
A sunlit heart with not a cloud between.
A heart like Thine, a heart divine.
A heart as white as snow;
On me, dear Lord, a heart like this bestow.

2.
I want dear Lord, a love that feels for all;
A deep strong love that answers every call,
A love like Thine, a love divine,
A love for high and low;
On me, dear Lord, a love like this bestow.

3.
I want, dear Lord, a soul on fire for Thee;
A soul baptised with heav’nly energy.
A willing mind, a ready hand
To do whate’er I know
To spread Thy light wherever I may go.

- George Jackson
