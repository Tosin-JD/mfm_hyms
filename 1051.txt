Sweet Promise-11.11.11.11. And Refrain

1.
Sweet is the promise,
"I will not forget thee,”
Nothing can molest or
turn my soul away;
E'en tho’ the night be
dark within the valley,
Just beyond is shining
one eternal day.

CHORUS
“I will not forget thee or leave thee;
In My hands I’ll hold thee,
In My hands I’ll hold thee,
in My arms I'll fold thee;
I will not forget thee or leave thee;
I am thy Redeemer, I will care for thee.”

2.
Trusting the promise,
“I will not forget thee,"
Onward will I go with
songs of joy and love;
Tho’ earth despise me,
tho’ my friends forsake me,
I shall be remembered
in my home above.

3.
When at the golden
portals I am standing,
All my tribulations,
all my sorrows past,
How sweet to hear the
blessed proclamation,
“Enter, faithful servant,
welcome home at last!”

- Charles H. Gabriel
