Sinner, How Thy Heart Is Troubled - 8.7.8.7.

1.
Sinner, how thy heart is troubled!
God is coming very near;
Do not hide thy deep emotion,
Do not check that falling tear.

CHORUS
Oh, be saved, His grace is free!
Oh, be saved, He died for thee!
Oh, be saved, He died for thee!

2.
Jesus now is bending o’er thee,
Jesus lowly, meek, and mild;
To the Friend who died to save
thee;
Wilt thou not be reconciled?

3.
Art thou waiting till the morrow?
Thou may’st never see its light:
Come at once! Accept His
mercy;
He is waiting - come tonight!

4.
With a lowly, contrite spirit,
Upward to the courts of heaven!
Let them sing, with holy rapture,
O’er another soul forgiven!
