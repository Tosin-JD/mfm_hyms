All Things Bright And Beautiful - 7.6.7.6. and Refrain

1.
Each little flower that opens,
each little bird that sings
he made their glowing colours,
he made their tiny wings.All things bright.

CHORUS
All things bright and beautiful,
all creatures great and small,
all things wise and wonderful
the Lord God made them all.

2.
The purple headed mountain,
the river running by,
the sunset, and the morning
that brightens up the sky:
All things bright.....

3.
The cold wind in the winter,
the pleasant summer sun,
the ripe fruits in the garden
he made them every one.
All things bright.....

4.
He gave us eyes to see them,
and lips that we might tell
how great is God almighty,
who has made all things well!
All things bright.....

- Cecil F. Alexander
