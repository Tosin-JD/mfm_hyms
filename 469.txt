Batty-8.7.8.7.

1.
Sweet the moments, rich in blessing,
Which before the cross I spend;
Life, and health, and peace possessing,
From the sinner's dying Friend.

2.
Here Iâ€™ll sit, for ever viewing
Mercy's streams in streams of blood;
Precious drops, my soul bedwing,
Plead, and claim my peace with God.

3.
Truly blessed is this station.
Low before His cross to lie;
While I see divine compassion
Beaming in His languid eye.

4.
Love and grief my heart dividing,
With my tears His feet I'll bathe;
Constant still in faith abiding,
Life deriving from His death.

5.
Lord, in ceaseless contemplation
Fix my thankful heart on Thee;
Till I taste Thy full salvation,
And Thine unveiled glory see.
