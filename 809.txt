Martydom - C. M.

1.
With joy we meditate the grace
Of our High Priest above;
His heart is made of tenderness,
And yearns with faithful love.

2.
Touch’d with a sympathy within,
He knows our feeble frame:
He knows what sore temptations mean,
For He has felt the same.

3.
He, in the days of feeble flesh,
Pour’d out His cries and tears
And in His measure feels afresh
What every member bears.

4.
He’ll never quench the smoking flax,
But raise it to a flame:
The bruised reed He never breaks,
Nor scorns the meanest name.

5.
Then let our humble faith address
His mercy and His power;
We shall obtain delivering grace
In every needful hour.

- Hugh Wilson
