Ring the Bells of Heaven

1.
Ring the bells of Heaven! there is joy today
For a soul returning from the wild!
See! The Father meets him out upon the way,
Welcoming His weary, wand’ring child.

CHORUS
Glory! glory! how the angels sing;
Glory! glory! how the loud harps ring!
‘Tis the ransomed army, like a mighty sea,
Pealing forth the anthem of the free!

2.
Ring the bells of Heaven! there is joy today.
For the wand’rer now is reconciled;
Yes, a soul is rescued from his sinful way.
And is born anew, a ransomed child.

3.
Ring the bells of Heaven! Spread the feast today!
Angels, swell the glad triumphant strain!
Tell the joyful tidings, bear it far away!
For a precious soul is born again.

- William O. Cushing
