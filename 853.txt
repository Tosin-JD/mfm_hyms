Stuttgart - 8.7.8.7.

1.
Zionâ€™s King shall reign victorious;
All the earth shall own His sway;
He will make His kingdom glorious;
He will reign through endless day.

2.
Nations, now from God estranged,
Then shall see a glorious light;
Night to day shall then be changed,
Heaven shall triumph in the sight.

3.
Then shall Isreal, long dispersed.
Mourning seek the Lord their God,
Look on Him whom once they
pierced,
Own and kiss the chastening rod.

4.
Mighty King, Thine arm revealing,
Now Thy glorious cause maintain;
Bring the nations help andhealing,
Make them subject to Thy reign.

- Thomas Kelly
