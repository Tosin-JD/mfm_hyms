What Is Our Calling’s Glorious Hope - C.M.

1.
What is our calling’s glorious hope
But inward holiness?
For this to Jesus I look up,
I calmly wait for this.

2.
I wait, till He shall touch me clean,
Shall life and power impart,
Give me the faith that casts out sin
And purifies the heart.

3.
This is the dear redeeming grace,
For every sinner free:
Surely it shall on me take place,
The chief of sinners, me.

4.
From all iniquity, from all,
He shall my soul redeem:
In Jesus I believe and shall
Believe myself to Him.

5.
When Jesus makes my heart Hishome,
My sin shall all depart;
And lo, He saith; I quickly come,
To fill and rule Thy heart.

6.
Be it according to Thy word!
Redeem me from all sin:
My heart would now receive Thee, Lord
Come in, my Lord, come in!

- Charles Wesley
