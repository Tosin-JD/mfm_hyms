He wore a crown of thorns

1.
‘Twas God’s own Son who came to earth,
Who chose to know a lowly birth;
But, tho’ King of matchless worth,
He wore a crown of thorns.

CHORUS
He wore a crown of thorns that
I might wear a crown of glory!
He laid His heav’nly splendours by
to bring me love’s sweet story.
In poverty He walked life’s way.
In Olive’s garden bowed to pray;
He wore a crown of thorns that
I might wear a crown of glory!

2.
Wonderful Counsellor was He,
Matchless His grace; how could it be
That, at the last, He wore for me
That bitter crown of thorns?

3.
Kind were the deeds that crowned each day,
Gracious the words His lips would say,
While He pursued the fateful way
To wear that crown of thorns.

4.
Never again His brow shall know
Piercings of agony and woe;
But ’twas for us that, here below,
He wore the crown of thorns.
