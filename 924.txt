1.
Truehearted, whole hearted, faithful, and loyal,
King of our lives, by Thy grace, we will be;
Under the standard, exalted and royal,
Strong in Thy strength, we will battle for Thee.

CHORUS
Peal out the watch word! silence it never!
Song of our spirits, rejoicing and free;
Peal out the watch word! Loyal forever,
King of our lives, by Thy grace we will be.

2.
True hearted, whole hearted, fullest allegiance
Yielding henceforth to our glorious King;
Valiant endeavour and loving obedience,
Freely and jealously now would we bring.

3.
Truehearted,wholehearted,
Saviour all glorious!
Take Thy great power and reign
Over our wills and affections victorious,
Freely surrendered and wholly Thine own.
