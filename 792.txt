O Saviour, May We Never Rest - C.M.

1.
O Saviour, may we never rest
Till Thou art formed within,
Till Thou hast calmed our troubled breast,
And crushed the power of sin.

2.
O may we gaze upon Thy Cross,
Until the wondrous sight
Makes earthly treasures seem but dross.
And earthly sorrows light.

3.
Until, released from carnal ties,
Our Spirit upward springs,
And sees true peace above the skies,
True joy in heavenly things.

4.
There as we gaze may we become
United, Lord, to thee;
And in a fairer, happier home
Thy perfect beauty see.
