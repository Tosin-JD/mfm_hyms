Coronation - C. M. with Repeats

1.
All hail the pow’r of Jesus' name!
Let angels prostrate fall;
Bring forth the royal diadem,
And crown Him Lord of all;

2.
Crown Him, ye martyrs of our God
who from His altar call;
Extol Him in whose path ye trod
And crown Him Lord of all.

3.
Ye chosen seed of Israel’s race,
Ye ransomed from the fall,
Hail Him who saves you by His
grace,
And crown Him Lord of all;

4.
sinners! whose love can ne'er
forget
The wormwood and the gall;
Go spread your trophies at His feet
And crown Him Lord of all.

5.
Let ev’ry kindred, ev’ry tribe,
On this terrestrial ball,
To Him all majesty ascribe,
And crown Him Lord of all;

6.
O that with yonder sacred throng
We at His feet may fall!
We’ll join the everlasting song,
And crown Him Lord of all;
