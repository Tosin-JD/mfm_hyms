The Love Of Jesus

1.
'Tis the love of Jesus
Cheers our hearts today,
Makes our earth an Eden,
Drives the clouds away.

CHORUS
Love of Jesus, love unbounded, love so free
Sweetest story ever told to me!
0 ‘Tis the love of Jesus
Lightens ev'ry task,
Gives us strength and comfort,
More than we can ask.

2.
Tis the love of Jesus
Makes our pathway bright,
Fills our hearts with singing,
And our lives with light.

4.
Blessed love of Jesus,
Freely to us giv’n
Theme of all the ages,
Sweetest song of heav'n.

- L. B. Mitchell
