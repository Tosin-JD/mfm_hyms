Lincoln - C.M.

1.
Day after day I sought the Lord,
And waited patiently;
Until He bent down from His throne.
And hearkened to my cry.

2.
He drew me from the fearful pit,
And from the miry clay;
He placed my feet upon a rock,
And led me in His way.

3.
He taught my soul a new made song,
A song of holy praise;
All they who see these things, withfear
That hopes to God shall raise.

4.
Most blessed is the man whose hope
Upon the Lord relies;
Who follows not the proud, nor those
That turn aside to lies.

5.
O Lord, what wonders hast Thou
All number far above;
Thy thoughts to us ward overflow
With mercy, grace, and love.

- Julius Charles Hare
