Tarsus -8.8.8.D.

1.
Come, Holy Ghost, all quickening fire!
Come, and my hallowed heart inspire,
Sprinkle with the atoning blood:
Now to my soul Thyself reveal,
Thy mighty working let me feel,
And know that I am born of God.

2.
Humble, and teachable, and mild,
O may I, as a little child,
My lowly Masterâ€™s steps pursue!
Be anger to my soul unknown,
Hate, envy, jealousy, be gone; -
In love create Thou all things new.

3.
Let earth no more my heart divide,
With Christ may I be crucified,
To Thee with my whole soul aspire:
Dead to the world and all its toys,
Its idle pomp, and fading joys, ,
Be Thou alone my one desire.

4.
My will be swallowed up in Thee;
Light in Thy light still may I see,
Beholding Thee with open face;
Called the full power of faith to prove.
Let all my hallowed heart be love,
And all my spotless life be praise,

- Charles Wesley
