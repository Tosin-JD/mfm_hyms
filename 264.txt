Whoever will - L.M.

1.
O wand’ring souls, why will roam
Away from God, away from House?
The Saviour calls, oh, hear Him say
“Whoever will” may come today!

CHORUS
"Whoever will” “who ever will”
“whoever will” may come today;
‘Whoever will” may come today,
And drink of the water of life.

2.
Behold His hands extended now,
The dews of night are on His brow;
He knocks, He calls, He waiteth still:
Oh, come to Him, “whoever will”

3.
In simple faith His word believe,
And His abundant grace receive;
No love like His the heart can fill;
Oh, come to Him, “whoever will!”

4.
The “Spirit and the bride say. Come!”
And find in Him sweet rest, and home;
Let him that heareth echo still
The blessed “whosoever will!”
