Jesus is calling

1.
Jesus is tenderly calling thee home
Calling today, calling today;
Why from the sunshine of love wilt thou roam
Farther and farther away?

CHORUS
Calling today, Calling today,
Jesus is calling,
Is tenderly calling today.

2.
Jesus is calling the weary to rest
Calling today, calling today;
Bring Him thy burden and thou shalt be blest
He will not turn thee away.

3.
Jesus is waiting, O come to Him now
Waiting today, waiting today;
Come with thy sins, at His feet lowly bow
Come, and no longer delay.

4.
Jesus is pleading, O list to His voice
Hear Him today, hear Him today;
They who believe on His name shall rejoice
Quickly arise and away.

285St. Mark -7.7.D.

1.
Sinners, turn: why will ye die?
God, your Maker, asks you why
God, who did your being give,
Made you with Himself to live
He the fatal cause demands,
Asks the work of His own hands;
Why, ye thankless creatures, why
Will you cross His love, and die?

2.
Sinners, turn: why will ye die?
God, your Saviour, asks you why
God, who did your souls retrieve,
Died Himself that ye might live.
Will you let Him die in vain.
Crucify the Lord again?
Why, ye ransom'd sinners, why
Will you slight His grace, and die?

3.
Sinners, turn: why will ye die?
God, the Spirit, asks you why
He who all your lives hath striven,
Urged you to contend for heaven;
Will you not His grace receive?
Will you still refuse to live?
Why, ye long-sought sinners, why
Will you grieve your God, and die.

4.
Can you doubt if God is love,
If to all His yearnings move?
Will you not His word receive?
Will you not His oath believe?
See, your dying Lord appears!
Jesus weeps: believe His tears!
Mingled with His blood they cry,
"Why will you resolve to die?‚Äù.

- Berthold Tours
