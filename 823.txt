Frogmore - 6.4.6.4.

1.
Beloved, let us love,
Love is of God;
In God alone hath love
Its true abode.

2.
Beloved, let us love:
For they who love,
They only are His sons.
Born from above.

3.
Beloved, let us love:
For love is rest.
And he who loveth not,
Abides unblest.

4.
Beloved, let us love:
In love is light,
And he who loveth not,
Dwelleth in night.

5.
Beloved, let us love:
For only thou
Shall we behold that God
Who loveth us.

- Horatius Bonar
