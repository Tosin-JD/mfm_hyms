Is Thy Heart Right

1.
Have thy affections been nail’d to the Cross?
Is thy heart right with God?
Dost thou count all things for Jesus but loss?
Is thy heart right with God?

CHORUS
Is thy heart right with God,
Wash’d in the crimson flood,
Cleans’d and made holy, humble and lowly,
Right in the sight of God?

2.
Hast thou dominion o'er self and o’er sin?
Is thy heart right with God?
Over all evil without and within?
Is thy heart right with God?

3.
Is there no more condemnation for sin?
Is thy heart right with God?
Does Jesus rule in the temple with in?
Is thy heart right with God?

4.
Are all thy pow’r under Jesus’ control?
Is thy heart right with God?
Does He each moment abide in thy soul?
Is thy heart right with God?

5.
Art thou now walking in heaven’s pure light?
Is thy heart right with God?
Is thy soul wearing the garment of white?
Is thy heart right with God?
