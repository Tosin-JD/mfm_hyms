Lura -10.7.10.7. With Refrain

1.
When the sun shines bright and your heart is light,
Jesus is the friend you need;
When the clouds hang low in this world of woe,
Jesus is the friend you need.

CHORUS
Jesus is the friend you need,
Such a friend is He indeed
He who noteth ev’ry tear,
He will banish ev’ry fear,
Jesus is the friend you need.

2.
If you’re lost in sin, all is dark within,
Jesus is the friend you need;
God alone can save thro’ the Son He gave,
Jesus is the friend you need.

3.
When in that sad hour, when in death’s grim pow'r,
Jesus is the friend you need;
If you would prepare ‘gainst the tempter’s snare,
Jesus is the friend you need.

4.
When the cares of life all around are rife,
Jesus is the friend you need;
Glory to His name, always He’s the same,
Jesus is the friend you need.
