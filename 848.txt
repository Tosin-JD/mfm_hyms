Bremen (Munich) -7.6.7.6.D.

1.
Lord of the living harvest
That whitens oâ€™er the plain,
Where angels soon shall gather
Their sheaves of golden grain,
Accept these hands to labour.
These hearts to trust and love,
And deign with them to hasten
Thy kingdom from above.

2.
As labourers in Thy vineyard
Lord, send them out to be,
Content to bear the burden
Of weary days for Thee,
Content to ask no wages
When Thou shalt call them home,
But to have shared the travail
That makes Thy kingdom come.

3.
Be with them, God the Father,
Be with them, God the Son,
Be with them, God the Spirit,
Eternal Three in One!
Make them a royal priesthood,
Thee rightly to adore,
And fill them with Thy fullness
Now and for evermore.

- John Samuel Bewley Monsell
