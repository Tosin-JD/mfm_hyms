England’s Lane - 7.7.7.7.7.7.

1.
Sing, 0 sing, this blessed morn!
Unto us a child is born,
Unto us a son is given,
God Himself comes down from heaven;

CHORUS
Sing, O sing, this blessed morn,
Jesus Christ today is born!

2.
God of God and Light of Light
Comes with mercies infinite,
Joining in a wondrous plan
Heaven to earth, and God to man:

3.
God with us, Emmanuel,
Deigns for ever now to dwell;
He on Adam’s fallen race
Sheds the fullness of His grace:

4.
God comes down that man may rise,
Lifted by Him to the skies,
Christ is Son of Man, that we
Sons of God in Him may be:

5.
O renew us, Lord, we pray,
With Thy Spirit day by day,
That we ever one may be,
With the Father and win Thee;

- C. Wordsworth
