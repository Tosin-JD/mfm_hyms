Strike for Victory

1.
Strike, oh, strike for vict’ry,
Soldiers of the Lord,
Buckling on the armour,
Trusting in His word;
Lift His royal banner
High above the world;
Satan from his stronghold
Shall be hurled!

CHORUS
Strike, strike for vict’ry, warriors bold!
Strike till the vict’ry you behold!
Strike, strike for vict’ry, ne’er give o’er!
Jesus is our Captain, vict’ry’s sure.

2.
Strike, oh, strike for victory,
Soldiers of the Cross,
Sacrificing pleasure,Glorying in loss;
Bind the helmet stronger,
Tighter grasp the sword,
Conquering and to conquer,
Battling for the Lord!

3.
Hand to hand united
Heart to heart as one,
Let us still keep marching,
Till the battle’s won,
Ever pressing forward,
'Mid the battle strife,
Till we gain the Kingdom,
Everlasting life.

- Mary A. Kidder
