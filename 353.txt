O Thou, From Whom All Goodness Flows - C.M.

1.
O Thou, from whom all goodness flows,
I lift my heart to Thee;
In all my sorrows, conflicts, woes,
Good Lord, remember me.

2.
When on my aching burdened heart
My sins lie heavily,
Thy pardon grant, Thy peace impart:
Good Lord, remember me.

3.
When trials sore obstruct my way,
And ills I cannot flee,
Then let my strength be as my day:
Good Lord, remember me.

4.
If worn with pain, disease, and grief,
This feeble spirit be,
Grant patience, rest, and kind relief:
Good Lord, remember me.

5.
And O, when in the hour of death
I bow to thy decree,
Jesus, receive my parting breath:
Good Lord, remember me.
