Christ chapel - 7.7.7.7.

1.
Come, my soul, thy suit prepare,
Jesus loves to answer prayer;
He Himself has bid thee pray,
Therefore will not say thee nay.

2.
Thou art coming to a King;
Large petitions with thee bring;
For His grace and power are such,
None can ever ask too much.

3.
With my burden I begin:
Lord, remove this load of sin,
Let Thy blood, for sinners spilt,
Set my conscience free from guilt.

4.
Lord, I come to Thee for rest;
Take possession of my breast;
There Thy blood bought right maintain
And without a rival reign.

5.
While I am a pilgrim here,
Let Thy love my spirit cheer:
As my Guide, my Guard, my Friend,
Lead me to my journeyâ€™s end.

- John Newton
