The Lord Hath Declared And The Lord Will Perform

1.
The Lord hath declared and the Lord will perform;
“Behold! I am near to deliver
A refuge and fortress, a covert in storm;”
He keepeth His promise for ever,

CHORUS
For ever! for ever! Oh, not for a day!
He keepeth His promise for ever!
To all who believe, to all who obey,
He keepeth His promise for ever!

2.
Who seek Him shall find Him, shall find Him today,
The word is to all, “whosoever”!
No soul that entreateth He turneth away;
He keepeth His promise for ever,

3.
Though often my toil seems but labour in vain.
I leave with The Lord my endeavour!
I patiently wait for the sunshine and rain.
He keepeth His promise for ever.

4.
The bonds that unite us in earth’s dearest ties.
The rude hand of Time will dissever
But we shall renew them again inthe skies;
He keepeth His promise for ever.
