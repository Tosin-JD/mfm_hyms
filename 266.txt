266
Abundantly able to save - P.M.

1.
Whoever receiveth the Crucified One,
Whoever believeth on God’s only Son,
A free and a perfect salvation shall have:
For He is abundantly able to save.

CHORUS
My brother, the Master is calling for thee;
His grace and His mercy are wondrously free!
His blood as a ransom for sinners He gave,
And He is abundantly able to save.

2.
Whoever receiveth the message of God,
And trusts in the power of the soul cleansing blood,
A full and eternal redemption shall have:
For He is both able and willing to save.

3.
Whoever repents and forsakes ev’ry sin,
And open his heart for the Lord to come in,
A present and perfect salvation shall have:
For Jesus is ready this moment to save.
