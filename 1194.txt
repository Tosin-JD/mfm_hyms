Schmucke Dich - 8.8.8.8.D.

1.
Deck yourself, my soul, with gladness;
leave the gloomy haunts of sadness.
Come into the daylight’s splendour,
There with joy your praises rendei
To the Lord whose grace unbounded
Has this royal banquet founded;
Though all other powers excelling,
With my soul he makes his dwelling.

2.
Lord, I bow before you lowly,
Filled with joy most deep and holy,
As with trembling awe and wonder
All your mighty works I ponder
How, by mystery surrounded,
Depth no man has ever sounded,
None may dare to pierce unbidden
Secrets that in you are hidden.

3.
Shining sun, my life you brighten,
Radiance, you my soul enlighten;
Joy, the best of all man’s knowing,
Fountain, swiftly in me flowing:
At your feet I kneel, my Maker
Let me be a fit partaker
Of this sacred food from heaven,
For our good, your glory, given.

4.
Jesus, Bread of life, I pray you,
Let me gladly here obey you;
Never to my hurt invited,
Always by your love delighted:
From this banquet let me measure,
Lord, how vast and deep its treasure;
Through the gifts your hands have given
Let me be you’ guest in heaven.
