857
The regions beyond

1.
To the regions beyond I must go, I must go,
Where the story has never been told;
To the millions that never have heard of His love,
I must tell the sweet story of old.

CHORUS
To the regions beyond
I must go, I must go,
Till the world, all the world,
His salvation shall know.

2.
To the hardest of places He calls me to go,
Not thinking of comfort or ease;
The world may pronounce me a dreamer, a fool,
Enough if the Master I please.

3.
Oh, ye that are spending your leisure and pow'rs
In pleasures so foolish and fond;
Awake from your selfishness, folly and sin,
And go to the regions beyond.

4.
There are other “lost sheep” that
the Master must bring,
And they must the message be told;
He sends me to gather them out of all lands,
And welcome them back to His fold.

- A. B. Simpson
