Gopsal -6.6.6.6.8.8.

1.
Rejoice, the Lord is king!
Your Lord and king adore:
mortals, give thanks and sing,
and triumph ever more:
Lift up your heart, lift up your voice:
Rejoice! Again I say, rejoice!

2.
Jesus, the saviour, reigns,
the God of truth and love;
when he had purged our stains
he took his seat above:
Lift up your heart, lift up your voice:
Rejoice! Again I say, rejoice!

3.
His kingdom cannot fail,
he rules both earth and heaven;
the keys of death and hell
to Jesus now are given:
Lift up your heart, lift up your voice:
Rejoice! Again I say, rejoice!

4.
He sits at Godâ€™s right hand,
till al! his foes submit
and bow to his command
and fall beneath his feet:
Lift up your heart, lift up your voice:
Rejoice! Again I say, rejoice!

5.
Rejoice in glorious hope!
Jesus the judge shall come
and take his servants up
to their eternal home:
We soon shall hear the archangel's voice:
the trumpet sounds rejoice, rejoice!

- C. Wesley
