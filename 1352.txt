1352
When Jesus reigns Within

1.
There is gladness in my soul
There is joy beyond control
Since Jesus reigns within
For He drives all sins away
and He brings the perfect day
Since Jesus reigns within

CHORUS
Since Jesus reigns within
Since Jesus reigns within
Were is peace that fills the soul
There is joy beyond control
Since Jesus reigns within

2.
There is rapture, there is peace
That for ever will increase
Since Jesus reigns within
‘ There are blessings waiting me
There is glorious victory
Since Jesus reigns within

3.
I am never left alone
When I am the Lord’s atone
Since Jesus reigns within
And it makes my soul rejoice
When by faith I hear His voice
Since Jesus reigns within

4.
I have heaven in my soul
Tho' the billows round me roll
Since Jesus reigns within
As I press my onward way
To the land of perfect day
Since Jesus reigns within

- R. D. Achely
