The Lord is Coming

1.
The Lord is coming by and by:
Be ready when He comes!
He comes from His fair home on high:
Be ready when He comes!
He is the Lord our Righteousness,
And comes His chosen ones to bless,
And at His Father’s throne confess:
Be ready when He comes!

CHORUS
Will you be ready when the
Bridegroom comes?
Will you be ready when the
Bridegroom comes?
Will your lamps be trimm’d and bright,
Be it morning, noon, or night?
Will you be ready when the
Bridegroom comes?

2.
He soon will come to earth again:
Be ready when He comes!
Begin His universal reign:
Be ready when He comes!
With Hallelujah heaven will ring,
When Jesus doth redemption bring;
Oh, trim your lamps to meet your
King!Be ready when He comes!

3.
Behold! He comes to one and all:
Be ready when He comes!
And soon we’ll hear the trumpet call:
Be ready when He comes!
To Judgement called at His command,
From every clime, from every land,
Before His throne we all must stand:
Be ready when He comes!
