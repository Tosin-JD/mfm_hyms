Calilee -8.8.8.8.

1.
Sweet is the work, my God, my King,
to praise your name, give thanks and sing;
to show your love by morning light,
and talk of all your truth at night.

2.
Sweet is the day, the first and best,
on which I share your sacred rest;
so let my heart in tune be found,
like David's harp of joyful sound.

3.
My heart shall triumph in the Lord
and bless his works, and bless his word:
Godâ€™s works of grace, how bright they shine
how deep his counsels, how divine!

4.
Soon I shall see and hear and know
all I desired on earth below,
and all my powers for God employ
in that eternal word of joy.

- Isaac. Watts
