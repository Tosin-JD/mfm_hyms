I WILL GUIDE THEE

1.
Precious promise God hath given
To the weary passer by,
On the way from earth to heaven,
“I will glide thee with Mine eye."

2.
When temptations almost win thee,
And thy trusted watchers fly,
Let this promise ring within thee:
“I will guide thee with Mine eye.”

3.
When thy secret hopes have
perishedIn the grave of years gone by,
Let this promise still be cherised,
“I will guide thee with Mine eye.”

4.
When the shades of life are falling,
And the hour has come to die.
Hear thy trusty Leader calling
“I will guide thee with Mine eye.”
