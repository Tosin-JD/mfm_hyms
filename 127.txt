Thanet-8.3.3.6.

1.
Ere I sleep, for every favour
This day showed
By my God,
I will bless my Saviour.

2.
O my Lord, what shall I render
To Thy name,
Still the same,
Gracious, good and tender?

3.
Thou hast ordered all my goings
In Thy way,
Heard me pray,
Sanctified my doings.

4.
Leave me not, but ever love me;
Let Thy peace
Be my bliss,
Till Thou hence remove me.

5.
Thou my Rock, my Guard, my Tower.
Safely keep,
While I sleep,
Me, with all Thy power.

6.
So, wheneâ€™er in death I slumber,
Let me rise
With the wise,
Counted in their number.
