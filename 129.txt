Christe Sanctorum -11.11.11.5.
Lighten our darkness now the day is ended:
Father in mercy, guard your children sleeping;
from every evil, every harm defended,
safe in your keeping.

2.
To the last hour, when heavenâ€™s day is dawning,
far spent the night that knows no earthly waking;
keep us as watchmen, longing for the morning,
till that day's breaking.

- Timothy Dudley-Smith
