Tell the glad story again

1.
Tell the glad story of Jesus, who came,
Full of compassion, the lost to reclaim;
Tell of redemption throâ€™ faith in His name:
Tell the glad story again!

CHORUS
Tell it again! Tell it again!
Tell the glad story to suffering man;
Tell it, oh tell it, again!

2.
Tell the glad story where, and opprest,
Many in bondage are sighing for rest;
Tell them in Jesus they all may be blest:
Tell the glad story again!

3.
Tell the glad story with patience and love,
Urging the lost ones His mercy to prove;
Tell them of mansions preparing above:
Tell the glad story again!

4.
Tell the glad story when Jordan's dark wave
Calleth our loved ones its billows to brave;
Tell them that Jesus is mighty to save:
Tell the glad story again!
