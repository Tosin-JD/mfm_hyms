St. Theodulph - 7.6.7.6.D.

1.
All glory, laud and honour
To Thee, Redeemer, King,
To whom the lips of children
Made sweet hosannas ring:

2.
Thou art the King of Israel,
Thou David’s royal Son,
Who in the Lord’s name comest,
The King and blessed One!
All glory, etc.

3.
The company of angels
Are praising Thee on high,
And mortal men and all things
Created make reply:All glory, etc.

4.
The people of the Hebrews
With palms before Thee went:
Our praise and prayer and anthems
Before Thee we present.
All glory, etc.

5.
To Thee, before Thy passion,
They sang their hymns of praise;
To Thee, now high exalted,
Our melody we raise:
All glory, etc.

6.
Thou didst accept their praises
Accept the praise we bring,
Who in all good delightest,
Thou good and gracious King!
All glory, etc.

- St Theodulph of Orleans
