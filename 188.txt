Vom Himmel hoch - L.M.

1.
Give heed, my heart, lift up thine eyes;
Who is it in yon manger lies?
Who is this child so young and fair?
The blessed Christ child lieth there.

2.
Ah, dearest Jesus, holy child,
Make Thee a bed, soft, undefiled,
Within my heart, that it may be
A quiet chamber kept for Thee.

3.
My heart for very joy doth leap,
My lips no more can silence keep;
I too must sing with joyful tongue,
That sweetest ancient cradle song:

4.
Glory to God in highest heaven,
Who unto men His Son hath given;
While angels sing with pious mirth,
A glad new year to all the earth.

- Martin Luther
