Take Me as I am - 8.8.8.6.

1.
Jesus, my Lord, to Thee I cry;
Unless Thou help me, I must die:
Oh, bring Thy free salvation nigh.
And take me as I am.

CHORUS
And take me as I am!
And take me as I am!
My only plea Christ died for me!
Oh, take me as I am!

2.
Helpless I am, and full of guilt;
But yet for me Thy blood was spilt,
And Thou canst make me what Thou wilt, 
And take me as I am.

3.
No preparation can-1 make,
My best resolves I only break,
Yet save me for Thine own name’s sake,
And take me as I am!

4.
Behold me. Saviour, at Thy feet,
Deal with me as Thou seest meet;
Thy work begin, Thy work complete,
But take me as I am!
