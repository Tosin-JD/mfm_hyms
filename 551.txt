A World Wide Revival

1.
For a world wide revival,
Blessed Master we pray,
Let the pow'r of the highest,
Be upon us today;
For this world dearly purchased,
By the blood of God’s Son,
Back from Satan’s dominion,
And from sin must be won.

CHORUS
Send the pow'r, Oh, Lord,
Send the pow’r, Oh Lord,
Send the Holy Ghost power,
let it now be out poured,
Send it surging and sweeping
like the waves of the sea.
Send a world wide revival,
and begin it in me.

2.
Send the showers of blessing,
As declared in Thy Word,
Let the Spirit of promise
On all flesh be outpoured;
Send the latter rain on us,
Till the land overflows,
Till the desert rejoicing,
Blossoms forth as the rose.

3.
There's a sound of a going
In the mulberry trees,
News of nations awaking,
Borne upon ev'ry breeze;
For the prayers of His children,
God in mercy doth own,
The revival’s beginning,
And the power’s coming down.

- Mrs. C. H. Morris
