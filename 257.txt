Jesus will not Cast you Out

1.
Tho' your sins are manifold
Jesus will not cast you out!
He's a Friend, of love untold
Jesus will not cast you out!
God, to save us ev'ry one,
Freely gave His only Son;
Come, whate'er you may have done
Jesus will not cast you out!

2.
Tho' you spurn'd Him day by day
Jesus will not cast you out!
Come to Him - the Light, the Way
Jesus will not cast you out!
He will cleanse and make you
whole;
Waves of sin may o'er you roll
He will save your deathless soul -
Jesus will not cast you out!

3.
Grace is freely offer'd now -
Jesus will not cast you out!;
At the cross, O wand'rer, bow
Jesus will not cast you out!
Come, nor turn again to sin!
Come, He bids you enter in!
Come, and life eternal win!
Jesus will not cast you out!
