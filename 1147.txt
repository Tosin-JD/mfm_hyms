Trust On -7.6.

1.
Trust on, trust on, believer!
Tho' long the conflict be,
Thou yet shalt prove victorious;
Thy God shall fight for thee.
CHORUS
Trust on! trust on!
Tho’ dark the night and drear:
Trust on! trust on!
The morning dawn is near.

2.
Trust on! the danger presses,
Temptation strong is near;
Over life’s dang’rous rapids
He shall thy passage steer.

3.
The Lord is strong to save us.
He is a faithful Friend:
Trust on, trust on, believer!
Oh, trust Him to the end!
