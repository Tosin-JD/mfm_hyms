Grainger - C. M.

1.
Workman of God! O lose not heart,
But learn what God is like.
And in the darkest battle-field
Thou shalt know where to strike.

2.
Thrice blest is he to whom is given
The instinct that can tell
That God is on the field when He
is most invisible.

3.
For God is other than we think;
His ways are far above,
Far beyond reasonâ€™s height, and reached
Only children love.

4.
Then learn to scorn the praise of man,
And learn to lose with God;
For Jesus won the world through shame,
And beckons thee His road.

5.
For right is right, since God is God,
And right the day must win;
To doubt would be disloyalty,
To falter would be sin.

- Frederick William Faber
