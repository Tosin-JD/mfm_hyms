Seeking The Lost

1.
Seeking the lost, yes, kindly entreating
Wanderers on the mountain astray;
‘Come to Me,’ His message repeating,
Words of the Master speaking today.

CHORUS
Going afar Upon the mountain,
Bringing the wand'rer back again, back again,
Into the fold Of my Redeemer.
Jesus the Lamb for sinners slain, for sinners slain.

2.
Seeking the lost, and pointing to Jesus,
Souls that are weak and hearts that are sore;
Leading them forth in ways of salvation,
Showing the path to life ever more.

3.
Thus I would go on missions of mercy,
Following Christ from day unto day;
Cheering the faint, and raising the fallen;
Pointing the lost to Jesus the way.
