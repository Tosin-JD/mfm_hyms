Sentimental Songs

1.
If you’re in the battle for the Lord and right,
Keep on the firing line.
If you win the vict’ry, brother, you must fight.
Keep on the firing line;
There are many dangers which we all must face,
If we die still fighting it is no disgrace.
Cowards in the service should not have a place,
Keep on the firing line.

CHORUS
You must fight and be brave against all evil.
Never run, tho foes combine;
If you would fight for God and right,
Keep on the firing line.

2.
God will only use a soldier He can trust.
Keep on the firing line.
If you wear the crown, then bear the cress you must.
Keep on the firing line;
Life is but to labour for the Master dear,
Help to banish darkness and to spread good cheer.
We shall be rewarded for ourservice here,
Keep on firing line.

3.
When we get to heaven we shall be so glad.
Keep on the firing line.
We shall praise the Saviour fer the call we had,
Keep on the firing line;
Twill be joy to see the souls we helped to win,
These we led to Jesus, from the paths of sin,
Hear their welcome plaudit and go marching in,
Keep on firing line.
