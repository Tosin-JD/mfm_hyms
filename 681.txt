Showalter -10.9.10.9. with Refrain

1.
What a fellowship, what a joy divine,
Leaning on the everlasting arms;
What a blessedness, what a peace in mine.
Leaning on the everlasting arms.

CHORUS
Leaning, leaning, 
Safe and secure from all alarms;
Leaning, leaning, Leaning on the everlasting arms.

2.
O how sweet to walk in this pilgrim way.
Leaning, leaning, Leaning on the everlasting arms;
O, how bright the path grows from day to day,
Leaning, leaning, Leaning on theeverlasting arms.

3.
What have I to dread, what have I to fear.
Leaning, leaning, Leaning on the everlasting arms?
I have blessed peace with my Lord so near.
Leaning, leaning, Leaning on the everlasting arms.

- Elisha A. Hoffman
