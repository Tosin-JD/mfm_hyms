Like Zion’s Holy Mount - C.M. with Refrain

1.
All they who put their trust in God
Can never be removed;
They stand secure like Zion’s mount,
By many ages proved.

CHORUS
Like the mount of God,
Like the mount of God;
They stand secure like Zion's mount,
By many ages proved.
They can never be removed, removed;
They stand secure like Zion’s mount,
They can never be removed.

2.
As round about Jerusalem
The rugged mountains lie,
So round about His holy saints
Our God is ever nigh.

3.
Tho' fierce the storm in fury beat
And awful thunders roar,
The children of the mighty God
Are safe for evermore.

4.
Thus over shadowed by His love,
Where harm can ne’er betide.
Within this refuge safe and sure
I ever would abide.

- C. M. Seamans
