Greenland - 7.6.7.6.D.

1.
From Greenland's icy mountains,
From India's coral strand,
Where Africa's sunny fountains
Roil down their golden sand;
From many an ancient river,
From many a palmy plain.
They call us to deliver
Their land from error's chain.

2.
What though the spicy breezes
Blow soft o'er Ceylon's isle
Though every prospect pleases,
And only man is vile:
In vain with lavish kindness
The gifts of God are strown,
The heathen in his blindness
Bows down to wood and stone.

3.
Can we, whose sou's are lighted
With wisdom from on nigh,
Can we to men benighted
The lamp of life deny?
Salvador), O salvation!
The joyful sound proclaim.
Till each remotest nation
Has leamt Messiahâ€™s name.

4.
Waft, waft, ye winds, His story,
And you, ye waters, roll;
Till, like a sea of glory.
It spreads from pole to pole;
Till o'er our ransom'd nature,
The Lamb for sinners slain.
Redeemer, King Creator,
In bliss retuns to reign.

- Sir G. J. Elvey
