1.
Near to Thy heart, O Christ divine,
Leaning like John on Thy breast
Till with Thy glory I will shine.
Near to Thy heart I'd rest.

2.
Near to Thy heart O may I be.
Hearing Thy sweet words of love,
Learning Thy precious will for me,
Seeking those things above.

3.
Near to Thy heart where all is peace,
Lost in the light of Thy face,
There will my faith and trust
increase,There will I grow in grace.

- John W. Peterson
