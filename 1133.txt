Bow Brickhill - 8.8.8.8.

1.
O Christ of all the ages, come!
we fear to journey on our own;
without you near we cannot face
the future months, the years unknown.

2.
Afflicted, tempted, tried like us,
you match our moments of despair;
with us you watch the desert hours,
and in our sorrows you are there.

3.
O Saviour, fastened to a cross
by tearing nails our selfish ways;
the grieving, caring Lord of love,
you bear the sins all our days.

4.
Triumphant from the grave you rise
the morning breaks upon our sight;
and with its dawning, future years
will shine with your unending light.

5.O Christ of all the ages, come!
the days and months and years go by;
accept our praise, redeem our lives:
our strength for all eternity.
