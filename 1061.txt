1061
I Am Bound For Canaan

1.
Storms do not alarm me,
they sometime must cease,
Trials cannot harm me,
for I have blessed peace;
All I’ve left behind me
I long for no more,
Better things shall find me
on Canaan's shore.

CHORUS
Let those who will, stay in Egypt land,
I am bound for Canaan,
Where milk and honey flowing.
shall ev’ry need supply;
All battles fought and the vict’ry won,
peace and joy my portion,
My soul shall rest,
on its shore by and by.

2.
Troubles do not fret me,
they cannot abide,
Tho’ they may beset me,
in Jesus I will hide;
All the world’s commotion
about me may roar,
There's no stormy ocean
on Canaan’s shore.

3.
I in grace abiding
and trying to stay
In the shadow hiding
of Canaan’s perfect day;
All I trust may fail me,
t’will matter no more,
Nothing can assail me
on Canaan’s shore.
