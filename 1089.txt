The sheltering rock

1.
There is a Rock in a weary land,
Its shadow falls on the burning sand,
Inviting pilgrims as they pass,
To seek a shade in the wilderness.

CHORUS
Then why will ye die?
O why will ye die?
When the Shelt’ring Rock is so near by,
O why will ye die?

2.
There is a Well in a desert plain,
Its waters call with entreating strain,
“Ho, ev'ry thirsting, sin sick soul,
Come, freely drink, and thou shalt be whole.”

3.
A great fold stands with its portals wide,
The sheep astray on the mountain side;
The Shepherd climbs o’er mountains steep;
He's searching now for His wandr'ing sheep.

4.
There is a cross where the Saviour died;
His blood flowed out in a crimson tide,
A sacrifice for sins of men,
And free to all who will enter in.

- Rev. W. E. Penn
