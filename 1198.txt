Ach, Gott Und Herr - 8.7.8.7.

1.
Strengthen for service, Lord, the hands
That holy things have taken;
Let ears that now have heard your songs
To clamour never waken.

2.
Lord, may the tongues which ‘Holy’ sang
Keep free from all deceiving;
The eyes which saw your love be bright,
The glorious hope perceiving:

3.
The feet that tread your holy courts
From light be never banished;
The bodies by your Body fed,
Be with new life replenished.
