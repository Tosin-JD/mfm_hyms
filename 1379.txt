Speak, my Lord

1.
Hear the Lord of harvest sweetly calling,
“Who will go and work for Me today?
Who will bring to Me the lost and dying?
Who will point them to the narrow way?”

CHORUS
Tidings of peace, Tidings of Jesus,
Redemption and release.

2.
Behold how many thousands still are lying
Bound in the darksome prison house in sin,
With none to tell them of the Saviour's dying,
Or of the life He died for them to win.

3.
Proclaim to ev'ry people, tongue and nation
That God in whom they live and move is love:
Tell how He stooped to save His lost creation,
And died on earth that man might live above.

3.
Give of Thy sons to bear the message glorious;
Give of thy wealth to speed them on their way;
Pour out thy soul for them in pray’r victorious;
And all thou spendest Jesus will repay.

CHORUS
Speak, my Lord, speak, my Lord,
Speak, and I’ll be quick to answer Thee;
Speak, my Lord, speak, my Lord,
Speak, and I will answer, “Lord, send me.”

2.
When the coal of fire touched the prophet,
Making him as pure, as pure can be,
When the voice of God said,
“Who'll go for us?"
Then he answered, “Here I am, send me."

2.
Millions now in sin and shame are dying.
Listen to their sad and bitter cry;
Hasten, brother, hasten to the rescue;
Quickly answer, “Master, here am I"

3.
Soon the time for reaping will be over;
Soon we'll gather for the harvest home:
May the Lord of harvest smile upon us.
May we hear His blessed, “Child, well done.”
