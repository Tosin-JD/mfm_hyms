Hark! Hark! The Song The Ransomed Sing

1.
Hark! hark! the song the ransomed sing,
A new-made song of praise
The Lord the Lamb they glorify,
And these the strains they raise;

CHORUS
“Glory to Him who loved us,
And washed us In His blood;
Who cleansed our souls from guilt and sin.
By that pure living flood!

2.
Made white by His redeeming blood,
Our heavenly garments shine;
Our minds, by Him enlightened prove,
The power of truth divine.

3.
By Jesus' blood we overcame
When Satan’s host assailed;
“Twas by the power of truth divine
Our feeble arms pre"ailed.

4.
Then be the lamb of God adorned
The Lord of Life and light!
To Him be glory, honour, power,
And majesty and might!”
