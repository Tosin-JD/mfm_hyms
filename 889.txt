O Why Not Tonight

1.
O do not let the Word depart,
And close thine eyes against the light;
Poor sinner, harden rot your heart,
Be saved, O tonight

CHORUS
O why not tonight?
O why not tonight?
Wilt thou be saved?
Then why not tonight?
2 Tomorrowâ€™s sun may never rise
To bless thy long deluded sight,
This is the time, O then be wise,
Be saved, O tonight

3.
Our Lord in pity lingers still
And wilt thou thus His love requite?
Renounce at once thy stubborn will,
Be saved, O tonight?

4.
Our blessed Lord refuses none
Who would to Him their souls unite;
Believe on Him, 'he work is done.
Be Saved O tonight.

- Elizabeth Reed
