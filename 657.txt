657
Nativity - C. M.
1 Father of Jesus Christ, my Lord,
My Saviour, and my Head,
I trust in Thee, whose powâ€™r word
Hath rais'd Him from the dead.

2.
Eternal life to all mankind
Thou hast in Jesus given;
And all who seek, in Him shall find
The happiness of heaven.

3.
Faith in Thy power Thou seest I have
For Thou this faith hast wrought;
Dead souls Thou callest from their grave,
And seekest worlds from nought.

4.
In hope, against all human hope,
Self-desperate, I believe;
Thy quickening word shall raise me up
Thou shalt Thy Spirit give.

5.
The thing surpasses all my thought,
But faithful is my Lord;
Through unbelief I stagger not
For God hath spoke the word.

6.
Faith, mighty faith, the promise sees,
And looks to that alone;
Laughs at impossibilities,
And cries: It shall be done!

- C. Wesley
