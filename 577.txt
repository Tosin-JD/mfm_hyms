When First The Risen Lord Of Power - 8.6.8.6.8.8.8.6.

1.
When first the risen Lord of Power
His chosen one sent forth,
A charge He gave, that solemn hour,
To preach His saving worth.
“Go ye" said He, “to all mankind;
Declare My word, and ye snail find:
These signs shall surely follow them
Who on My name believe.”

2.
“No demons shall stand before them
No poison do them harm:
Nor subtle serpent in their hand
Cause pain or dread alarm."
For Satan’s kingdom He o’ercame.
To give His people right to claim:
These signs shall surely follow them;
Who on My name believe.

3.
“They shall with other tongues declare
The wonders of their God;
The sick beneath their heads, by prayer,
Shall rise, to prove My Word.”
So let it be! Firm as His Throne
Stands this clear promise to His own:
These signs shall surely follow them
Who on My name believe.

4.
Crowned with the flame of Pentecost,
A faithful, fearless band
Proclaimed His Name: a ransomed host
Arose from every land.
The Lord worked with them from on High,
His proven Word could none deny:
These signs shall surely follow them
Who on My name believe.

5.
No word of Thine is void of power;
No promise, Lord, is vain,
Be this a Pentecostal hour
Confirm Thy Word again!
Nor canst Thou fail! Thou art the same
As when of old Thou didst proclaim:
These signs shall surely follow them
Who on My name believe.
