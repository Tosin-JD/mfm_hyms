Ellacombe -D.C.M.

1.
We limit not the truth of God
To our poor reach of mind.
By notions of our day and sect,
Crude, partial, and confined:
No, let a new and better hope
Within our hearts be stirred:
The Lord hath yet more light and
truth
To break forth from His word.

2.
Darkling our great forefathers went
The first steps of the way;
â€˜Twas but the dawning, yet to grow
Into the perfect day.
And grow it shall, our glorious sun
More fervid rays afford:

3.
The valleys past, ascending still,
Our souls would higher climb,
And look down from supernalheights
On all the bygone time.
Upward we press, the air is clear:
And the sphere music heard;

4.
O Father, Son, and Spirit, send
Us increase from above,
Enlarge, expand all Christian souls
To comprehend Thy love;
And make us all go on to know.
With nobler powers conferred,
The Lord hath yet more light and truth
To break forth from His word.
