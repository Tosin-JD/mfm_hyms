Don’t Turn Him Away

1.
Patiently, tenderly pleading,
Jesus is standing today;
At your heart's door He knocks as before.
Oh, turn Him no longer away!

CHORUS
Don t turn Him away. Don t turn Him away.
He has come back to your heart again,
Altho’ you've gone astray.
Oh, how you'll need Him to plead your cause
On that eternal day!
Don't turn the Saviour away from your heart;
Don't turn Him away.

2.
Gracious, compassionate mercy
Bro’t Him from mansions above;
Caused Him to wait Just out-side your gate.
Oh, yield to His wonderful love!

3.
Can you not now hear Him calling?
Do not ill treat such a Friend.
Give up your sin. Oh, let Him come in!
Lo ! He will be true to the end.

4.
Now is the time to receive Him;
Grant Him admission today.
Grieve Him no more, But open your door,
And turn Him no longer away.
