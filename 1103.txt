If Your Heart Keeps Right

1.
If the dark shadows gather As you go along,
Do not grieve for their coming, Sing a cheery song,
There is joy for the taking, it will soon be light.
Ev’ry cloud wears a rainbow If your
heart keeps right.

CHORUS
If your heart keeps right, If your heart keeps right,
There’s a song of gladness in the darkest night;
If your heart keeps right, If your heart keeps right,
Ev'ry cloud will wear a rainbow,
If your heart keeps right.

2.
Is your life just a tangle Full of toil and care?
Smile a bit as you journey, Others’ burdens share;
You’ll forget all your troubles, Making their lives bright,
Skies will grow blue and sunny If your heart keeps right.

3.
There are blosoms of gladness ‘Neath the winter’s snow,
From the gloom and the darkness Comes the morning’s glow;
Never give up the battle, You will win the fight,
Gain the rest of the Victor If your heart keeps right.
