Lyons-10.10.11.11.

1.
Jehovah the Lord, our Saviour and King.
Glad praises to Thee we ever shall sing;
We come to Thine altar, the place of retreat,
Where-we shall find peace at Thine own mercy seat.

2.
Thanksgivings we bring in our songs to Thee,
For bounties of earth, for fruit of the tree,
For glorious fountains of water so pure,
For temples of worship all time to endure.

3.
Abundant the yield of ripe fruited grain,
From forest and field, from valley and plain;
The verdant green pastures, souseful to man,
Are tokens of blessings in Thy wondrous plan.

4.
O Jesus our Lord, Thou ruler of all,
Thou art ever true, what ever the call;
Be Thou our defender in all time of stress.
And help us live daily in true thankfulness.

- Edwin McNeely
