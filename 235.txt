Why not say yes tonight

1.
Oh, why not say Yes to the Saviour tonight?
He’s tenderly pleading with thee,
To come to Him now with thy sin burden’d heart
For pardon so full and so free, so free.

CHORUS
Why not say Yes tonight?
Why not? Why not?
While He so gently, so tenderly pleads:
Oh, accept Him tonight!

2.
For with you the Spirit will not always plead
Oh, do not reject Him tonight!
Tomorrow may bring you the
darkness of death,
Unbroken by heavenly, heav’nly light.

3.
Take Christ as your Saviour, then all shall be well,
The morrow let bring what it may;
His love shall protect you, His Spirit guide,
And safely keep you in His way, His way.
