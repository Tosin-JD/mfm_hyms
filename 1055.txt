Tell It To Jesus

1.
Are you weary, are you heavy hearted?
Tell it to Jesus, Tell it to Jesus;
Are you grieving over joys departed?
Tell it to Jesus alone.

CHORUS
Tell it to Jesus, tell it to Jesus
He is a friend that's well known;
You have no other such a friend or brother,
Tell it to Jesus alone.

2.
Do the tears flow down your cheeks unbidden?
Tell it to Jesus, Tell it to Jesus;
Have you sins that to man’s eyes are hidden?
Tell it to Jesus alone.

3.
Do you fear the gath’ring clouds of sorrow?
Tell it to Jesus, Tell it to Jesus;
Are you anxious what shall be tomorrow?
Tell it to Jesus alone.

4.
Are you troubled with the thought of dying?
Tell it to Jesus, Tell it to Jesus;
For Christ’s coming kingdom are you sighing?
Tell if to Jesus alone.
