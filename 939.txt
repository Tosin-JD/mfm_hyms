The Fight is On

1.
The fight is on, the trumpet sound is ringing out,
The cry ‘To arms!” is heard afar and near;
The Lord of hosts is marching on to victory,
The triumph of the Christ will soon appear.

CHORUS
The fight is on, O Christian soldier,
And face to face in stern array,
With armor gleaming, and colors streaming,
The right and wrong engage today!
The fight is on, but be not weary;
Be strong, and in His might hold fast;
If God be for us, His banner o'er us,
We’ll sing the victor’s song at last!

2.
The fight is on, arouse, ye soldiers brave and true!
Jehovah leads, and vict’ry will assure;
Go, buckle on the armor God has given you,
And in His strength unto the end endure.

3.
The Lord is leading on to certain victory;
The bow of promise spans the eastern sky;
His glorious name in ev’ry land shall honored be;
The morn will break, the dawn of peace is nigh.
