Ibstone - 6.6.6.6.

1.
Thy way, not mine, 0 Lord,
However dark it be!
Lead me by Thine own hand,
Choose out the path for me.

2.
Smooth let it be or rough,
It will be still the best;
Winding or straight, it leads
Right onward to Thy rest.

3.
I dare not choose my lot;
I would not if I might;
Choose Thou for me, my God,
So shall I walk aright.

4.
Take Thou me cup, and it
With joy or sorrow fill.
As best to Thee may seem;
Choose Thou my good or ill:

5.
Choose Thou for me my friends,
My sickness or my health;
Choose Thou my cares for me.
My poverty or wealth.

6.
Not mine, not mine the choice.
In things or great or small;
Be Thou my guide and strength,
My wisdom and my all.

- Horatius Bonar
