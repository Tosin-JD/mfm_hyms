Scales-11.11.11.11. with Refrain

1.
Set my soul afire, Lord, for Thy holy Word,
Burn it deep within me let Thy voice be heard;
Millions grope in darkness in this day and hour,
0 will be a witness, fill me with Thy pow’r.

CHORUS
Set my soul afire, lord, set my soul afire,
Make my life a witness of Thy saving pow’r.
Millions grope in darkness, waiting for Thy Word,
Set my soul afire, Lord, Set my soul afire.

2.
Set my soul afire, Lord, for the lost in sin,
Give to me a passion as I seek to win;
Help me not to falter, never let me fall.
Fill me with Thy Spirit, let Thy will prevail.

3.
Set my soul afire, Lord, in my daily life,
Far too long I’ve wandered in this day of strife;
Nothing else will matter but to live for Thee,
I will be a witness, for Christ lives in me.
