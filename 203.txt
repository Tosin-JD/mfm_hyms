1.
Come all you good people and burst into song!
be joyful and happy, your praises prolong;
remember the birthday of Jesus our King,
who bring us salvation: his glory we sing.

2.
His mother, a virgin so gentle andpure,
was told of God's promise unchanging and sure,
foretelling the birthday of Jesus our King,
who brings us salvation: his glory we sing.

3.
To Bethlehem hurried the shepherds amazed,
with stories of angels and heavens that blazed,
proclaiming the birthday of Jesus our King,
who brings us salvation: his glory we sing.

4.
So come let us honour the babe in the hay
and give him our homage and worship today,
recalling the birthday of Jesus our King,
who brings us salvation: his glory we sing.
