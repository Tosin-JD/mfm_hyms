Ein’ Feste Burg - P.M.

1.
Lift up your heads, eternal gates;
Ye everlasting doors, give way:
The King, the King of glory comes.
Ascending to His throne today!
Who is the King of glory?
Who is the King of glory?
It is the Lord of might,
The Victor in the fight,
Triumphant o’er the powers of night.

2.
Lift up your heads, eternal gates;
Ye gates of pearl, and streets of gold;
The King, the King of glory comes;
Before His chariot wheels unfold!
Who is the King of glory?
Who is the King of glory?
The Lord of hosts is He,
The God of Majesty,
He is the King eternally.

3.
Now with the Father, God most High,
And with the Spirit, ever one,
The angels own the Christ, the King,
And bow before His shining throne.
He is the King of glory,
He is the King of glory!
Him let all earth adore;
To Him our praises pour,
For ever and for evermore.
