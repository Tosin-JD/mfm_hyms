Laudate Dominum -10.10.11.11.

1.
O praise to the Lord!
praise Him in the height;
rejoice in his word
you angels of light:
you heavens adore him
by whom you were made,
and worship before him
in brightness arrayed.

2.
O praise ye the Lord!!
praise Him upon earth
in tuneful accord,
you saints of new birth:
praise Him who has brought you
his grace from above;
praise him who has taught you
to sing of his love.

3.
O praise ye the Lord!
all things that give sound,
each jubilant chord
re-echo around;
loud organs, his glory
proclaim in deep tone,
and sweet harp, the story
of what he has done.

4.
O praise ye the Lord!
thanksgiving and song
to him be outpoured
all ages along:
for love in creation,
for heaven restored,
for grace of salvation,
O praise ye the Lord!
