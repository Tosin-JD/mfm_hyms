Just A Closer Walk With Thee

1.
I am weak but Thou art strong,
Jesus keep me from all wrong;
I’ll be satisfied as long
As I walk close to Thee.

CHORUS
Just a closer walk with Thee,
Grant it, Jesus, this my plea;
Daily let it ever be
Just a closer walk with Thee.

2.
Thru this world of toils and snares,
If I falter Lord, who cares?
Who with me my burden shares?
Let me walk close to Thee.

3.
When my feeble life is o’er,
Time for me will be no more.
Guide me to that peaceful shore,
Let me walk close to Thee.
