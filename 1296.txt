Penlan -7.6.7.6.D.

1.
His eyes will guide my footsteps
when faltering age is near;
his light will lift my darkness
and help my ears to hear:
in faith I claim the promise
of Jesusâ€™ love for me;
the Lord of hope and healing
who made the blind to see.

2.
When others fail or leave me,
he comes to me in prayer;
when life no longer needs me
I find my comfort here:
his promises are faithful
he lives, my closest friend;
I know that he will keep me
until my days shall end.

3.
He comes when I am weary,
in pain or in distress;
with patient understanding
and perfect gentleness:
he was far more forsaken
than I shall ever be;
the presence of my Saviour
is everything to me.

- C. Porteous
