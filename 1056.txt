Burdens Are Lifted At Calvary

1.
I Days are filled with sorrow and care,
Hearts are lonely and drear;
Burdens are lifted at Calvary, ,
Jesus is very near.

CHORUS
Burdens are lifted at Calvary,
Calvary, Calvary;
Burdens are lifted at Calvary
Jesus is very near.

2.
Cast your care on Jesus today.
Leave your worry and fear;
Burdens are lifted at Calvary
Jesus is very near

3.
Troubled soul, the Saviour can see
Ev'ry heart - ache tear,
Burdens are lifted at Calvary
Jesus is very near

- John M. Moore
