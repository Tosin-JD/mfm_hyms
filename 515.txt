Darwall’s 148th - 6.6.6.6.4.4.4.4.

1.
Ascended Christ, who gained
the glory that we sing,
anointed and ordained,
our prophet, priest, and King:
by many tongues
the church displays
your power and praise
in all her songs.

2.
No titles, thrones, or powers
can ever rival yours;
no passing mood of ours
can turn aside your laws:
you reign above
each other name
of worth or fame,
the Lord of love.

3.
Now from the Father’s side
you make your people new;
since for our sins you died
our lives belong to you:
from our distress
you set us free
for purityand holiness.

4.
You call us to belong
within one body here;
in weakness we are strong
and all your gifts we share:
in you alone
we are complete
and at your feet
with joy bow down.

5.
All strength is in your hand,
all power to you is given;
all wisdom to command
in earth and hell and heaven:
beyond all words
creation sings
the King of kings
and Lord of lords.

- Christopher Idle
