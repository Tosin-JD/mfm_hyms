Brecon - C. M.

1.
Spirit divine, attend our pray’r.
And make our heart Thy home;
Descend with all Thy gracious pow’r;
Come, Holy Spirit, come.

2.
Come as the light! to us reveal
The truth vie long to know;
Reveal the narrow path of right,
The way of duty show.

3.
Come as the fire and purge our hearts
Like sacrificial flame,
Till our whole souls an off ring be
In love's redeeming name.

4.
Come as the wind, O Breath of God!
O Pentecostal grace!
Come, make Thy great salvation known,
Wide as the human race.

- Andrew Reed
