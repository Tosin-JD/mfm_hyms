St. Flavian - C.M.

1.
There is a book, who runs may read,
Which heavenly truth imparts;
And all the lore its scholars need.
Pure eyes and Christian hearts.

2.
The works of God above, below,
Within us and around,
Are pages in that book to show
How God Himself is found.

3.
The glorious sky embracing all
Is like the Maker's love;
Wherewith encompass'd, great and small
In peace and order move.

4.
The moon above, the church below,
A wondrous race they run;
But all their radiance, all their glow,
Each borrows of its sun.

5.
The Saviour lends the light and heat
That crown His holy hill;
The saints, like stars, around His seat
Perform their courses still.

6.
The dew of heaven is like Thy grace,
It steals in silence down;
But where it lights, the favour'd place.
By richest fruits is known.

7.
One name above all glorious names,
With its ten thousand tongues.
The everlasting sea proclaims,
Echoing angelic songs.

8 Thou, who hast given me eyes to see
And love this sight so fair.
Give me a heart to find out Thee,
And read Thee everywhere.

- T. Ravenscroft
