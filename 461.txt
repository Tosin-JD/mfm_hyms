461
You Can Touch Him

1.
The God that made the world out yonder
and others yet unknown, Reached out His hand
in mighty power and spoke from heaven's throne.
“Let there be earth, Let there be man,
And give Him all therein.'' 
But all too soon man chose the path way that leads to death and sin.

CHORUS
The mighty God of all creation
is the loving God of our salvation.
And you can touch His hand of healing,
You can touch Him now, if you’ll only try.

2.
He reached again, this time in mercy
with gentle hand so kind. To heal the man
of sin and sickness to soothe his angry mind.
And still today with hands now reaching
The Saviour stands near by, And you can touch
His hand of healing if you will only try.
