Maryton - L. M.

1.
Come, Holy Spirit, heavenly Dove,
With all thy quickening powers,
Kindle a flame of sacred love
In these cold hearts of ours.

2.
Look! how we grovel here below,
Fond of these earthly toys;
Our souls can neither fly nor go
To reach eternal joys.

3.
Dear Lord, and shall we ever live
At this poor dying rate,
Our love so faint, so cold to Thee,
And Thine to us so great?

4.
God, thro' Himself, we then shall know,
If Thou within us shine;
And sound, with all Thy saints below,
The depths of love divine.

4.
Come, Holy Spirit, heavenly Dove.
With all thy quickening powers;
Come, shed abroad a Saviourâ€™s love,
And that shall kindle ours.

- Isaac Watts
