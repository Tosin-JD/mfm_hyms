Redeemed

1.
Redeemed how I love to proclaim it.
Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb;
Redeemed thro His infinite mercy,
His child and forever I am.

CHORUS
Redeemed, Redeemed,
Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb,
Redeemed, Redeemed,
His child and forever I am.

2.
Redeemed and so happy in Jesus,
No language my rapture can tell;
I know that the light of His
presence
With me doth continually dwell.

3.
I think of my blessed Redeemer,
I think of Him all the day long;
I sing, for I cannot be silent,
His love is the theme of my song.

4.
I know I shall see in His beauty,
The King in whose law I delight;
Who lovingly guardeth my footsteps,
And giveth me songs in the night.

5.
I know thereâ€™s crown that is waiting
In yonder bright mansion tor me.
And soon with the spirits made perfect,
At home with the Lord I shall be.
