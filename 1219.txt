Maryton -8.8.8.8.(L.M.)

1.

Jesus the Lord of love and life,
draw near to bless this man and wife;
as they are now in love made one,
let your good will for them be done.

2.
Give them each day your peace and joy.
let no dark clouds these gifts destroy;
in growing trust may love endure,
to keep their marriage bond secure.

3.
As they have vowed to have and hold,
each by the other be consoled;
in wealth or want, in health or pain,
till death shall part, let love remain.

4.
Deepen, O Lord, their love for you,
and in that love, their own renew;
each in the other find delight,
as lives and interests now unite.

5.
Be to them both a guide and friend,
through all the years their home defend;
Jesus the Lord of love and life,
stay near and bless this man and wife.

- James E. Seddon
