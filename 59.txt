1.
O God of our fathers, we praise and adore Thee
For all Thy great mercies through years that are gone;
Thy guidance and goodness through many generations
Have brought us now at last to a new day’s bright dawn.

2.
Help us to be faithful to Thee and Thy kingdom,
Thy church, and the work of our Christ in all lands:
May loyalty, sacrifice, courage now attend us,
And bring to fullest triumph Thy work in our hands.

3.
Our task is no greater than that which our fathers
Assumed with fidelity, courage, and pride:
We know that all mountains will vanish now before us
If Thou wilt point the way and remain at our side.

4.
We now re-affirm our undying devotion;
We pray Thou wilt fill us with all strength and grace:
Crown all high endeavours with victories for ever,
And may we run with faithfulness life’s fateful race.
