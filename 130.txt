Saviour, Breathe An Evening Blessing -8.7.8.7.

1.
Saviour, breathe an evening blessing,
Ere repose our spirits seal;
Sin and want we come confessing;
Thou canst save, and Thou canst heal.

2.
Though the night be dark and dreary,
Darkness cannot hide from Thee;
Thou art Fie who, never weary,
Watchest where Thy people be.

3.
Though destruction walk around us,
Though the arrow past us fly,
Angels guard from Thee surround us,
We are safe if Thou art nigh.

4.
Blessed Spirit, brooding oâ€™er us.
Chase the darkness of our night,
Till the perfect day before us
Breaks in everlasting light.

- James Edmeston
