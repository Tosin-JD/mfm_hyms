Wirksworth - S.M.

1.
Ah! Whither should I go,
Burdened, and sick, and faint?
To whom should I my troubles show,
And pour out my complaint?

2.
My Saviour bids me come;
Ah! why do I delay?
He calls the weary sinner home.
And yet from Him I stay

3.
What is it keeps me back,
From which I cannot part,
Which will not let my Saviour take
Possession of my heart?

4.
Some cursed thing unknown
Must surely lurk within,
Some idol, which I will not own.
Some secret bosom sin.

5.
Jesus, the hindrance show,
Which I have feared to see;
Yet let me now consent to know
What keeps me out of Thee.

6.
Searcher of hearts, in mine
Thy trying power display;
Into its darkest comers shine,
And take the veil away.

7.
I now believe in Thee
Compassion reigns alone;
According to my faith to me
O let it, Lord, be done!

- Charles Wesley
