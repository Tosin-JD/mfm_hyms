THE SAVIOUR WITH ME

1.
I must have the Saviour with me,
For I dare not walk alone;
I must feel His presence near me.
And His arm around me thrown.

CHORUS
Then my soul shall fear no ill,
Let Him lead me where He will,
I will go without a murmur,
And His footsteps follow still.

2.
I must have the Saviour with me,
For my faith, at best, is weak;
He can whisper words of comfort
That no other voice can speak.

3.
I must have the Saviour with me,
In the onward march of life.
Thro' the tempest and the sun shine,
Thro' the battle and the strife.

4.
I must have the Saviour with me,
And His eye the way must guide;
Till I reach the vale of Jordan,
Till I cross the rolling tide.
