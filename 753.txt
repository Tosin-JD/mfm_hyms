What Various Hindrances We Meet - L.M.

1.
What various hindrance we meet,
In coming to the mercy-seat!
Yet who that knows the worth of prayer
But wishes to be often there?

2.
Prayer makes the darken’d cloud withdraw;
Prayer climbs the ladder Jacob saw,
Gives exercise to faith and love,
Brings every blessing from above.

3.
Restraining prayer we cease to fight;
Prayer makes the Christian's armour bright;
And Satan trembles when he sees
The weakest saint upon his knees.

4.
Have we no words? ah! Think again:
Words flow apace when we complain,
And fill our fellow creature’s ear
With the sad tale of all our care.

5.
Were half the breath thus vainly spent
To heaven in supplication sent,
Our cheerful song would oftener be
Hear what the Lord hath done for me.
