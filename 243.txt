243
Yes, I know

1.
Come, ye sinners, lost and hopeless,
Jesus' blood can make you free;
For He saved the worst among you.
When He saved a wretch like me

CHORUS
And I know, yes, I know,
Jesus’ blood can make the vilest sinner clean.
And I know, yes, I know,
Jesus’ blood can make the vilest sinner clean.

2.
To the faint He giveth power,
Through the mountains makes a way;
Findeth water in the desert,
Turns the night to golden day.

3.
In temptation He is near thee,
Holds the pow'rs of hell at bay;
Guides you to the path of safety,
Gives you grace for ev’ry day.

4.
He will keep thee while the ages
Roll thro’ out eternity;
Tho’ earth hinders and hell rages,
All must work for good to thee.

- Mrs. Anna W. Waterman
