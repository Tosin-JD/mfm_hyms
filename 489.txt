Crown the Saviour - 8.7.8.7.4.7.

1.
Lord, enthroned in heavenly splendour,
First begotten from the dead,
Thou alone, our strong Defender,
Liftest up Thy people’s head.
Alleluia, Alleluia, Jesu, True and living Bread!
Alleluia, Alleluia, Jesu, True and living Bread!

2.
Here our humblest homage pay we;
Here in loving reverence bow;
Here, for faith’s discernment pray we,
Lest we fail to know Thee now.
Alleluia.
Thou art here, we ask not how.

3.
Though the lowliest form doth veil Thee
As of old in Bethlehem,
Here as there Thine angels hail Thee,
Branch and Flower of Jesus' stem.
Alleluia.
We in worship join with them.

4.
Paschal Lamb, Thine Offering, finished
Once for all when Thou wast slain,
In its fullness undiminished
Shall for evermore remain,
Alleluia.
Cleansing souls from every stain.

5.
Life imparting Heavenly Manna.
Stricken Rock with streaming Side,
Heav’n and earth with loud Hosannas,
Worship Thee, the Lamb who died.
Alleluia.
Risen, ascended, glorified!

- Geo C. Stebbins
