I Know That My Redeemer Liveth

1.
I know that my Redeemer liveth.
And on the earth again shall stand;
I know eternal life He giveth,
That grace and power are in His hand.

CHORUS
I know, I know that Jesus liveth,
And on the earth again shall stand;
I know, I know that life He giveth,
That grace and power are in His hand.

2.
I know His promise never faileth,
The word, He speaks, it cannot die;
Tho’ cruel death my flesh assaileth,
Yet I shall see Him by and by.

3.
I know my mansion He prepareth,
That where He is there I may be;
O wondrous tho’t, for me He careth,
And He at last will come for me.
