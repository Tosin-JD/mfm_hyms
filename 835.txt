1.
Jesus, still lead on,
Till our rest be won;
And, although the way be cheerless.
We will follow calm and fearless:
Guide us by Thy handTo our Fatherland.

2.
If the way be drear.
If the foe be near,
Let not faithless fears o'ertake us,
Let not faith and hope forsake us;
For through many a foe
To our home we go.

3.
When we seek relief
From a long-felt grief,
When oppress'd by new temptations.
Lord, increase and perfect patience;
Show us that bright shore
Where we weep no more.

4.
Jesus, still lead on,
Till our rest be won.
Heavenly Leader, still direct us.
Still support, console, protect us,
Till we safely stand
In our Fatherland.

- Charles Vincent
