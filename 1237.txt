In Memoriam - 8.6.7.6.7.6.7.6.

1.
There’s a Friend for little children
Above the bright blue sky;
A friend who never changeth,
Whose love can never die.
Unlike our friends by nature,
Who change with changing years,
This Friend is always worthy
The precious name He bears.

3.
There’s a home for little children
Above the bright blue sky,
Where Jesus reigns in glory,
A home of peace and joy;
No home on earth is like it
Nor can with it compare.
For every one is happy,
Nor can be happier there.

3.
There’s a robe for little children
Above the bright blue sky,
A harp of sweetest music,
A palm of victory.
All, all above is treasured.
And found in Christ alone.
Lord, grant thy little children
To know Thee as their own.

- A. Midlane
