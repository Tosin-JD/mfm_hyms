St. Timothy - C. M.

1.
My Father, for another night
Of quiet sleep and rest,
For all the joy of morning light,
Thy holy name be blest.

2.
Now with the new-born day I give
Myself anew to thee,
That as thou wiliest I may live,
And what thou wiliest be.

3.
Whate'er I do, things great or small,
Whateâ€™er I speak or frame,
Thy glory may I seek in all,
Do all in Jesus' name.

4.
My Father, for his sake, I pray,
Thy child accept and bless;
And lead me by thy grace today
In paths of righteousness.

- Sir H.W. Baker
