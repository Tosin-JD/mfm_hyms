Mercy is boundless and free

1.
Praise be to Jesus, His mercy is free:
Mercy is free, mercy is free!
Sinner, that mercy is flowing for thee
Mercy is boundless and free!
If thou art willing on Rim to believe:
Mercy is free, mercy is free!
Life everlasting thou mayest receive:
Mercy is boundless and free!

CHORUS
Jesus, the Saviour, is seeking for thee,
seeking for thee, seeking for thee;
Lovingly, tenderly calling for thee,
Calling and seeking for thee!

2.
Why on the-mountains of sin wilt thou roam?
Mercy is free, mercy is free!
Gently the Spirit is calling thee home:
Mercy is boundless and free!
Art thou in darkness? oh,come to the light:
Mercy is free, mercy is free!
Jesus is waiting. Heâ€™ll save you tonight:
Mercy is boundless and free!

3.
Think of His goodness, His patience, and love:
Mercy is free, mercy is free!
Pleading thy cause with His Father above:
Mercy is boundless and free!
Come, and repenting, oh, give Him thy heart:
Mercy is free, mercy is free!
Grieve Him no longer, but come as thou art:
Mercy is boundless and free!

4.
Yes; there is pardon for all who believe:
Mercy is free, mercy is free!
Come, and this moment a blessing receive:
Mercy is boundless and free!
Jesus is waiting, oh, hear Him proclaim:
Mercy is free, mercy is free!
Cling to His promise, believe on His name:
Mercy is boundless and free!
