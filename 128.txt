Quem Pastores Laudavere - 8.8.8.7.
1 Light of gladness, Lord of glory,
Jesus Christ our king most holy,
shine among us in your mercy:
earth and heaven join their hymn.

2.
Let us sing at sunâ€™s descending
as we see the lights of evening,
Father, Son, and Spirit praising
with the holy seraphim.

3.
Son of God, through all the ages
worthy of our holiest praises,
yours the life that never ceases,
light which never shall grow dim.

- Christopher Idle
