Jesus, I will Trust Thee - 6.5.

1.
Jesus, I will trust Thee,
Trust Thee with my soul:
Guilty, lost, and helpless,
Thou canst make whole.
There is none in heaven
Or on earth like Thee;
Thou hast died for sinners
Therefore, Lord, for me.

CHORUS
In Thy love confiding,
I will seek Thy face,
Worship and adore Thee,
For Thy wondrous grace.
Jesus, I will trust Thee,
Trust Thee with my soul!
Guilty, lost, and helpless,
Thou canst make me whole.

2.
Jesus, I can trust Thee,
Trust Thy written Word;
Since Thy voice of mercy
I have often heard.
When Thy Spirit reacheth,
To my taste how sweet!
Only may I hearken,
Sitting at Thy feet.

3.
Jesus, I do trust Thee,
Trust Thee without doubt;
“Whosoever cometh,"
Thou “wilt not cast out”:
Faithful is Thy promise,
Precious is Thy blood
These my soul’s salvation,
Thou my Saviour God!
