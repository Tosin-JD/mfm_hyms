Halton Holgale - 87.8.7.

1.
Firmly I believe and truly
God is Three and God is One;
and I next acknowledge duly
manhood taken by the Son.

2.
And I trust and hope most fully
in that manhood crucified;
and each thought and deed unruly
do to death, for he has died.

3.
Simply to his grace and wholly
light and life and strength belong;
and I love supremely, solely,
Christ the holy, Christ the strong.

4.
And I make this affirmation
for the love of Christ alone:
holy Church is his creation
and his teachings are her own.

5.
Honour, glory, power, and merit
to the God of earth and heaven,
Father, Son, and Holy Spirit
praise for evermore be given!
