Brown - C. M.

1.
With joy we hail the sacred day
Which God has called His own;
With joy the summons we obey
To worship at His throne.

2.
Spirit of grace, O deign to dwell
Within Thy church below!
Make her in holiness excel,
With pure devotion glow.

3.
Let peace within her walls be found;
Let all her sons unite,
To spread with grateful zeal around
Her clear and shining light.

4.
Great God, we hail the sacred day
Which Thou hast called Thine own;
With joy the summons we obey
To worship at Thy throne.

- Harriet Auber
