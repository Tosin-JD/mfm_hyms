227
Come and see

1.
â€˜Tis the gospel invitation,
Come and see, come and see.
Unto ev'ry tribe and nation,
Come and see, come and see,
Jesus offers free salvation, come and see,

CHORUS
What the Lord hath done for me.
Come and see, come and see
What the Lord hath done for me,
For He found my soul in sin,
and He washed me pure and clean,
This the Lord hath done for me.

2.
Oh, He never will deceive you,
Come and see, come and see,
Of your burden He'll relieve you.
Come and see, come and see,
He is waiting to receive you, come and see,

3.
Come, to Jesus now confiding,
Come and see, come and see,
In His shadow quickly hiding,
Come and see, come and see,
In His mercy there abiding come and see.
