Can He Depend On You

1.
Jesus the Saviour came down from above,
Came to bring mercy and love;
â€œCrucify him" the mob scornfully cried.
So He on Calvary died.
While on the cross He prayed:
Father, forgive,
For us He died that for Him we might live.
Can He depend on you?

CHORUS
Can He depend on you.
His blessed will to do?
Will you be crowned with faithful and true,
Can He depend on you?

2.
He from the grave on the third day arose.
Missions of man to disclose;
Go preach the gospel, all who will may hear.
Thru Him be free from all fear;
Bid them believe, to repent and obey,
Walk in the newness of life;
Keep the light glowing to show them the way
Leading from sin arid strife.

3.
Jesus the the Savour is coming
again,With His own ever to reign,
Are you preparing to stand by His side.
Or in that day be denied?
Have you told others the story of love,
Showing them what they should do?
These are the precepts that come from above,
Can He depend on you?
