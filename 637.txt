Ombersley - L.M.

1.
O walk with Jesus, would’st thou know
How deep, how wide His love can flow!
They only fail His love to prove
Who in the ways of sinners rove.

2.
Walk thou with Him; that way is light,
All other pathways end in night:
Walk thou with Him; that way is rest,
All other pathways are unblest.

3.
O walk with Jesus! to thy view
He will make all things sweet and new;
Will bring new fragrance from each flower,
And hallow every passing hour.

4.
J BUS, a great desire have we
To walk life’s troubled path with Thee:
Come to us now, in converse stay;
And 0! walk with us day by day.

- Edwin Paxton Hood
