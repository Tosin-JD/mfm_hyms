1.
Jesus, our best beloved friend,
Draw out our souls in pure desire;
Jesus, in love to us descend,
Baptise us with Thy Spiritâ€™s fire.

2.
On Thy redeeming name we call.
Poor and unworthy though we be:
Pardon and sanctify us all.
Let each Thy full salvation see.

3.
Our souls and bodies we resign
To fear and follow Thy commands:
O take our hearts, Our hearts are Thine,
Accept the service of our hands.

4.
Firm, faithful, watching unto prayer,
May we Thy blessed will obey,
Toil in Thy vineyard here, and bear
The heart and burden of the day.

5.
Yet, Lord, for us a resting place
In heaven at Thy right hand prepare:
And till we see Thee face to face
Be all our conversation there.

- James Montgomery
