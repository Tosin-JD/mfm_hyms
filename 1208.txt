The Day Is Come, The Feast Is Nigh - C. M.

1.
The day is come, the feast is nigh
I give Myself to you
Behold I give my blood to you
Shed for your redemption.

2.
Till my Father’s kingdom above
Before I drink again
By then, no more shall tears be shed
It shall be joy for aye.

3.
This supper shall e’er continue
Until his kingdom come
All o’er the world shall many souls
Eat this supper and drink.

4.
God’s blessing shall be poured from heav’n
Upon all those who eat
And from my Father’s throne on high
I'll prepare them a place.

5.
But now, for the present I'll drink
The bitter cup for you
And for your sakes, I'll drink the cup
Of sore anguish of death.

6.
Ye cannot know my deep sorrow
Nor yet, my glory seen
But this, continue ye to do
And thus, remember me.
