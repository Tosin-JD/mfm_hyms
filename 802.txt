1.
God is love; His mercy brightens
All the path in which we rove;
Bliss He wakes and woe He lightens:
God is wisdom, God is love.

2.
Chance and change are busy ever;
Man decays and ages move;
But His mercy waneth never:
God is wisdom, God is love.

3.
E’en the hour that darkest seemeth
Will His changeless goodness prove;
Thro’ the gloom His brightness streameth:
God is wisdom, God is love.

4.
He with earthly cares entwineth
Hope and comfort from above;
Every where His glory shineth:
God is wisdom, God is love.

- John Bowring
