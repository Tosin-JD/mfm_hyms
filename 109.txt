There is Sunshine

1.
There is sunshine in the valley
There is sunshine on the hill
Jesus brought it to this darken'd world below,
There is sunshine in the flowers,
Blooming by the rippling rill,
There is blessed sunshine ev'ry where I go

CHORUS
Sunshine, sunshine of His love divine
Sunshine, sunshine beams so brightly shine
sunshine, sunshine, in this world below,
sunshine, sunshine ev'rywhere I go

2.
There is sunshine on the meadow,
And upon the mossy lane,
Where the birds are warbling notes of joy and praise
There is sunshine on the mountain
Let all nature now the happy chorus praise.

3.
Tho' the world is full of sunshine
Brightly beaming evâ€™ryday
There are souls who live in
darkness all the while
They have never heard of Jesus
Nor His tender, loving care,
Let us help and cheer them with a sunny smile
