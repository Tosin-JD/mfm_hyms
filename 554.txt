554
He Abides

1.
I’m rejoicing night and day,
As I walk the pilgrim way,
For the hand of God in all my life I see,
And the reason of my bliss,
Yes, the secret all is this:
That the Comforter abides with me.

CHORUS
He abides, He abides,
Hallelujah, He abides with me!
I'm rejoicing night and day,
As I walk the narrow way,
For the Comforter abides with me.

2.
Once my heart was full of sin,
Once I had no peace within,
Till I heard how Jesus died upon the tree;
Then I fell down at His feet,
And there came a peace so sweet,
Now the Comforter abides with me.

1.
He is with me ev’ry where,
And He knows my ev'ry care.
I’m as happy as a bird and just as free;
For the Spirit has control,
Jesus satisfies my soul,
Since the Comforter abides with me.

2.
There’s no thirsting for the things
Of the world they’ve taken wings;
Long ago I gave them up, and instantly
All my night was turn’d to day,
All my burdens roll’d away,
Now the Comforter abides with me.
