Boylston - S.M.

1.
The Holy Ghost is here,
Where saints in prayer agree,
As Jesus’ parting Gift is near
Each pleading company.

2.
Not far away is He,
To be by prayer bro’t nigh,
But here in present majesty.
As in His courts on high.

3.
He dwells within our soul,
An ever welcome guest;
He reigns with absolute control,
As monarch in the breast.

4.
Obedient to Thy will.
We wait to feel Thy pow'r;
O Lord of life, our hopes fulfil,
And bless this hallowed hour.

- Charles H. Spurgeon
