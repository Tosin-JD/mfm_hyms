The Healing Waters

1.
Oh, the joy of sins forgiv’n,
Oh, the bliss the blood washed know.
Oh. the peace akin to heav’n,
Where the healing waters flow.

CHORUS
Where the healing waters flow,
Where the joys celestial glow,
Oh, there’s peace and rest and love
Where the healing waters flow!

2.
Now with Jesus crucified,
At His feet I’m resting low;
Let me evermore abide
Where the healing waters flow.

3.
Oh. this precious perfect love!
How it keeps the heart aglow,
Streaming from the fount above,
Where the healing waters flow.

4.
Oh, to lean on Jesus’ breast,
While the tempests come and go!
Here is blessed peace and rest.
Where the healing waters flow.

5.
Cleansed from ev’ry sin and stain,
Whiter than the driven snow,
Now I sing my sweet refrain, *
Where the healing waters flow.
