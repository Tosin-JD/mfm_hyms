Barnby-8.8.8.8.8.8.

1.
Weary of wandering from my God
And now made willing to return,
I hear and bow me to the rod;
For Thee, not without hope, I mourn:
I have an Advocate above,
A Friend before the throne of love.

2.
O Jesu, full of truth and grace,
More full of grace than I of sin,
Yet once again I seek Thy face,
Open Thine arms and take me in;
And freely my backslidings heal.
And love the faithless sinner still.

3.
Thou know'st tne way to bring me back, 
My fallen spirit to restore:
Oh, for Thy truth and mercyâ€™s sake,
Forgive, and bid me sin no more;
The ruins of my soul repair,
And make my heart a house of prayer.

4.
Ah! give me. Lord, the tender heart
That trembles at the approach of sin;
A godly fear of sin impart,
Implant, and root it deep within;
That I may dread Thy gracious power
And never dare offend Thee more.
