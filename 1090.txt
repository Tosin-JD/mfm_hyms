Jesus answers prayer

1.
Plead the precious promises of Jesus,
Cast upon Him all your anxious care,
Call upon Him and He will deliver,
For Jesus answers prayer.

CHORUS
Jesus answers prayer, Jesus answers prayer,
Cast on Him your burden, roll on Him your care,
Plead His word of love and His promise prove,
For Jesus answers prayer.

2.
When the storm and stress of life surround you,
And the load seems more than you can bear,
Go to Him for aid and He will help you,
For Jesus answers prayer.

3.
When perplexing problems you are facing,
And the path seems rugged evâ€™rywhere,
Look to Jesus, he will safely guide you,
For Jesus answers prayer.

4.
Matters not what sorrows may enfold you,
There is One who can your heart aches share;
Go to Him whatever may befall you,
For Jesus answers prayer.
