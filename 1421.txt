Sine Nomine - 10.10.10. with Alleluias

1.
For all the saints who from their labors rest,
Who Thee by faith Before the world confessed,
your name, O Jesus, be for ever blessed:
Alleluia, alleluia!

2.
You were their rock, their fortress, and their might,
You, Lord, their captain in the well-
fought fight;and in the darkness their unfailing Light:
Alleluia, alleluia!

3.
So may your soldiers, faithful, true, and bold,
Fight as the saints who nobly fought of old.
And win with them the victor's crown of gold:
Alleluia, alleluia!

4.
One holy people, fellowship divine!
We feebly struggle, they in glory shine;
in earth and heaven the saints in praise combine:
Alleluia, alleluia!

5.
And when the fight is fierce, the warfare long,
far off we hear the distant triumph- song;
and hearts are brave again, and arms are strong,
Alleluia, alleluia!

6.
The golden evening brightens in the west:
soon, soon to faithful warriors comes their rest,
the peaceful calm of paradise the blessed.
Alleluia, alleluia!

7.
But look! there breaks a yet more glorious day:
saints all-triumphant rise in bright array;
The King of glory passes on His way:
Alleluia, alleluia!

8.
From earth’s wide bounds, from dawn to setting sun,
Through heaven’s gates to God the Three-in-One
they come, to sing the song on earth begun-
Alleluia, alleluia!
