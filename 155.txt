St. Silvester -P.M.

1.
Days and moments quickly flying
Speed us onward to the dead:
Oh, how soon shall we be lying
Each within his narrow bed!

2.
Jesus, merciful Redeemer,
Rouse dead souls to hear Thy voice;
Wake, oh wake each idle dreamer
Now to make the eternal choice.

3.
Mark we wither we are wending;
Ponder how we soon must go
To inherit bliss unending,
Or eternity of woe.

4.
As a shadow life is fleeting;
As a vapour so it flies;
For the bygone years retreating
Pardon grant, and make us wise.

5.
Wise that we our days may number,
Strive and wrestle with our sin,
Stay not in our work nor slumber
Till Thy holy rest we win.

6.
Soon before the Judge all glorious
We with all the dead shall stand;
Saviour, over death victorious,
Place us then on Thy right hand.
