Barnstaple -10.10.10.10.

1.
It passeth knowledge, that dear love of Thine,
My Saviour, Jesus- yet this soul of mine
Would of Thy love, in all its breadth and length,
Its height and depth, its everlasting strength,
Know more and more.

2.
It passeth telling, that dear love of Thine,
My Saviour, Jesus: yet these lips of mine
Would fain proclaim to all men, far and near,
A love which can cast out all faithless fear.
And waken love.

3.
It passeth praises, that dear love of Thine,
My Saviour, Jesus: yet this heart of mine
Would sing that love, so full, so rich, so free,
Which draws a guilty fugitive like me
Nigh unto God.

4.
But tho I cannot sing, or tell, or know
The fullness of Thy love, while here below
My empty vessel I may freely bring;
0 Thou, who art of love the living spring.
My vessel fill.

1.
And when Thee, Saviour, face to face I see.
When at Thy glorious throne I bow the knee,
Then of Thy love, in all its breadth and length,
Its height and depth, its everlasting strength.
My soul shall sing.

- Henry J. Edwards
