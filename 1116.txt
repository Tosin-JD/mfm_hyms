0 Jesus My Shepherd Thou Art - 8.7.8.7.8.7.

1.
O Jesus my Shepherd Thou art
Then, fear and distrust remove
From the lion and the wild bear
And from wild and evil beasts
Jesus will guard His lonely sheep
Jesus will care for His own.

2.
Satan nearly over powered me
Jesus said, “this is my sheep”
He died in order to save me
Jesus, what great love is this?
With Jesus, victory is sure
There’s nought Him can overcome.

3.
He leads me in the way of Life,
Near the gently flowing stream,
He makes me rest in green pastures
Where poisonous weeds do not grow,
There I hear the voice of Jesus
There he makes my heart rejoice.

2.
When I walk the valley of death
And there’s fear along my way
I shall not fear any evil
For my Shepherd is so near,
His rod and staff they comfort me
For they make His sheep rejoice.

- John Newton (1779)
