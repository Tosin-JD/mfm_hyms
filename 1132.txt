St. Matthias - 8.8.8.8.8.8.

1.
Still near me, O my Saviour, stand
and guard me in temptationâ€™s hour;
within the hollow of your hand
uphold me by your saving power:
no force in earth or hell shall move
or ever tear me from you love.

2.
Still let your love point out my way
what gifts of grace your love has
brought!still counsel me from day to day,
direct my work, inspire my thought:
and if I fall, soon let me hear
your voice, and know that love is near.

3.
In suffering, let your love be peace,
in weakness let your love be power:
and when the storms of life shall cease,
Jesus, in that tremendous hour,
through death to life still be my guide
and save me then, for whom you died!

- Charles Wesley
