Christian Walk carefully - 10.10.10.10.

1.
Christian, walk carefully; danger is near!
On in thy journey with trembling and fear;
Snares from without, and temptations within,
Seek to entice thee once more into sin.

CHORUS
Christian, walk carefully: Christian, walk carefully,
Christian, walk carefully: danger is near!

2.
Christian, walk cheerfully through the fierce storm,
Dark though the sky with its threats of alarm;
Soon will the clouds and the trees be o’er,
Then with thy Saviour thou’ll rest evermore.

3.
Christian, walk prayerfully: oft wilt thou fall,
If thou forget on thy Saviour to call.
Safe thou shalt walk through trial and care,
If thou art clad in the armour of prayer.
