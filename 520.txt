Warrington -8.8.8.8. (L.M.)

1.
Where high the heavenly temple stands,
the house of God not made with hands,
a great high priest our nature wears,
the guardian of mankind appears.

2.
He who for us as surety stood
and poured on earth his precious blood,
pursues in heaven his mighty plan,
the saviour and the friend of man.

3.
Though now ascended up on high,
he sees us with a brother’s eye;
he shares with us the human name
and knows the frailty of our frame.

4.
Our fellow sufferer yet retains
a fellow feeling of our pains,
he still remembers in the skies
his tears, his agonies and cries.

5.
With boldness therefore at his throne
let us make all our sorrows known:
to help us in the darkest hour,
we ask for Christ the saviour’s power.

- M. Bruce
