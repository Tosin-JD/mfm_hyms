St. Aubin-8.5.8.5.

1.
Praise the Saviour, ye who know Him;
Who can tell how much we owe Him?
Gladly let us render to Him
All we have and are.

2.
"Jesus‚Äù is the name that charms us;
He for conflicts fits and arms us;
Nothing move and nothing harm us,
When we trust Him.

3.
Trust in Him, ye saints forever;
He is faithful, changing never;
Neither force nor guile can sever
Those He love from Him.

4.
Keep us, Lord, oh, keep us cleaving
To Thyself and still believing,
Till the hour of our receiving
Promised joys in heaven.

5.
Then we shall be where would be;
Then we shall be what we should be;
Things which are not now, nor could be,
Then shall be our own.
