Kildrostan -8.8.8.4.

1.
One thing I of the Lord desire,
For all my way hath miry been
Be it by water or by fire,
O make me clean!

2.
If clearer vision Thou impart,
Grateful and glad my soul shall be;
But yet to have a purer heart
Is more to me.

3.
Yea, only as the heart is clean
May larger vision yet be mine,
For mirrored in its depths are seen
The things divine.

4.
I watch to shun the miry way,
And stanch the spring of guilty thought;
But, watch and wrestle as I may,
Pure I am not.

5.
So wash Thou me without, within,
Or purge with fire, if that must be,
No matter how, if only sin
Die out in me.
