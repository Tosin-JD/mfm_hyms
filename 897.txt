My Saviour’s Love - 8.7.8.7. with Refrain

1.
I stand amazed in the presence
Of Jesu the Nazarene,
And wonder how He could love me,
A sinner, condemned, unclean.

CHORUS
How marvelous! how wonderful!
And my song shall ever be:
How marvelous! how wonderful!
Is my Saviour’s love for me!

2.
For me it was in the garden
He prayed, “not My will, but Thine,”
He had no tears for His own griefs,
But sweat drops of blood for mine.

3.
In pity angels beheld Him,
And came from the world of light
To comfort Him in the sorrows
He bore for my soul that night.

4.
He took my sins and my sorrows,
He made them His very own;
He bore the burden to Calv'ry,
And suffered and died alone.

5.
When with the ransomed in glory
His face I at last shall see,
Twill be my joy thru the ages
To sing of His love for me.

- Charles H. Gabriel
