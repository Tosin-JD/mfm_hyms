There’s a Call Comes Ringing o’er The Restless Wave - P. M.

1.
There's a call comes ringing o’er the restless wave,
Send the light! Send the light!
There are souls to rescue, there are souls to save,
Send the light! Send the light!

CHORUS
Send the light the blessed gospel light,
Let us shine from shore to shore!
Send the light! And let its radiant beams
Light the world for evermore.

2.
We have heard the Macedonian call today,
Send the light! Send the light!
And a golden off ring at the cross we lay,
Send the light! Send the light!

3.
Let us pray that grace may everywhere abound,
Send the light! Send the light!
And a Christ like spirit everywhere be found.
Send the light! Send the light!

4.
Let us not grow weary in the work of love,
Send the light! Send the light!
Let us gather jewels for a crown above.
Send the light! Send the light!

- Chas. H. Gabriel (1890)
