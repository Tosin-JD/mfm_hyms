1.
Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in Thee;
Let the water and the blood,
From Thy riven side which flowed,
Be of sin the double cure,
Cleanse me from its guilt and pow’r.

2.
Not the labours of my hands
Can fulfil Thy law’s demands;
Could my zeal no respite Know,
Could my tears forever flow,
All for sin could not atone;
Thou must save and Thou alone.

3.
Nothing in my hand I bring,
Simply to Thy cross I cling;
Naked, come to Thee for dress,
Helpless, look to Thee for grace;
Foul, I to the fountain fly,
Wash me. Saviour or I die!

4.
While I draw this fleeting breath.
When my eyes shall close in death,
When I rise to worlds unknown.
See Thee on Thy judgement throne,
Rock of Ages, cleft for me.
Let me hide myself in Thee.
