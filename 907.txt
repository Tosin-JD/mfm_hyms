I’m Gonna Keep on Singing

1.
I’m gonna keep singing,
I’m gonna keep on shouting,
I’m gonna keep on lifting my voice
and let the world know Jesus saves.

2.
I'm gonna keep on marching,
I'm gonna keep on fighting,
I’m gonna keep on lifting my voice
and let the world know Jesus saves.

3.
You trumpets keep on sounding,
You bells keep on ringing,
And ev’ry body keep lifting your voice
and let the world know Jesus saves.
