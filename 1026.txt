Never lose sight of Jesus

1.
O pilgrim bound for the heav’nly land,
Never lose sight of Jesus!
He’ll lead you gently with loving hand:
Never lose sight of Jesus!

CHORUS
Never lose sight of Jesus,
Never lose sight of Jesus'
Day and night He will lead you right;
Never lose sight of Jesus!

2.
When you are tempted to go astray,
Never lose sight of Jesus!
Press onward, upward, the narrow way;
Never lose sight of Jesus!

3 Though dark the pathway may seem ahead.
Never lose sight of Jesus!
“I will be with you,” His word hath said:
Never lose sight of Jesus!

4.
When death is knocking outside the door,
Never lose sight of Jesus!
Till safe with Him on the golden' shore
Never lose sight of Jesus!
