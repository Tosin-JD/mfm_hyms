No, Never Alone

1.
‘Fear not, I am with thee’;
Blessed golden ray.
Like a star of glory
Lighting up my way!Thro’ the clouds of midnight
This bright promise shone,
'I will never leave thee,
Never will leave thee alone.'
CHORUS
No, never alone, No, never alone;
He promised never to leave me,
Never to leave me alone No, never
alone,
No, never alone; He promised never
to leave me,
Never to leave me alone.

2.
Roses fade around me,
Lilies bloom and die.
Earthly sun beams vanish,
Radiant still the sky!
Jesus, Rose of Sharon,
Blooming for His own,
Jesus, heaven’s sunshine.
Never will leave me alone.

3.
Steps unseen before me,
Hidden dangers near;
Nearer still my Saviour,
Whispering, ‘Be of cheer;’
Joys, like birds of spring time,
To my heart have flown,
Singing all so sweetly,
‘He will not leave me alone.’
