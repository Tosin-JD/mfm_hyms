His Grace Aboundeth More

1.
O what a wonderful Saviour,
In Jesus my Lord I have found,
Tho’ I had sins without number,
His grace unto me did abound.

CHORUS
His grace aboundeth more,
His grace aboundeth more,
Tho’ sin abounded in my heart,
His grace aboundeth more.

2.
When a poor sinner He found me,
No goodness to offer had I;
Often His law I had broken,
And merited naught but to die.

3.
Nothing of merit possessing,
All helpless before Him I lay,
But in the precious blood flowing
He wash’d all my sin stains away.

4.
In Him my gracious Redeemer,
My Prophet, my Priest and my King;
Mercy I find and forgiveness,
My all to His keeping I bring.

5.
How can I keep from rejoicing?
I’ll sing of the joy in my soul;
Praising the love of my Saviour,
While years of eternity roll.
