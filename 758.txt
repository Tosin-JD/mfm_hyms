1.
Walk in the light: so shalt thou know
That fellowship of love
His Spirit only can bestow,
Who reigns in light above.

2.
Walk in the light: and sin, abhorred,
Shall ne’er defile again;
The blood of Jesus Christ thy Lord
Shall cleanse from every stain.

3.
Walk in the light: and thou shalt find
Thy heart made truly His,
Who dwells in cloudless light enshrined,
In whom no darkness is.

4.
Walk in the light: and thou shalt own
Thy darkness passed away,
Because that light hath on thee shone,
In which is perfect day.

5.
Walk in the light: and e’en the tomb
No fearful shade shall wear;
Glory shall chase away its gloom,
For Christ hath conquered there.

6.
Walk in the light: and thine shall be
A path, though thorny, bright;
For God, by grace, shall dwell in thee,
And God Himself is Light.
