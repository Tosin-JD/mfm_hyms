1.
All creation join to say:
Christ the Lord is risen today!
raise your joys and triumphs high;
sing, you heavens, and earth reply:
Alleluia!

2.
Love’s redeeming work is done;
fought the fight, the battle won:
see, our Sun’s eclipse has passed;
see, the dawn has come at last!
Alleluia!

3.
Vain the stone, the watch, the seal:
Christ has burst the gates of hell;
death in vain forbids his rise
Christ has opened paradise:
Alleluia!

4.
Now he lives, our glorious king;
now, O death, where is your sting?
Once he died, our souls to save
where’s your victory, boasting grave?
Alleluia!

5.
So we rise where Christ had led,
following our exalted head;
made like him, like him we rise
ours the cross, the grave, the skies:
Alleluia!

6.
Hail the Lord of earth and heaven!
praise to you by both be given;
every knee to you shall bow,
risen Christ, triumphant now:
Alleluia!
