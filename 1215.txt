God, give us Christian homes!
Homes where the Bible is loved and taught,
Homes where the Masterâ€™s will is sought.
Homes crowned with beauty Thy love hath wrought;
God, give us Christian homes;
God, give us Christian homes!

God, give us Christian homes!
Homes where the father is true and strong,
Homes that are free from the blight of wrong,
Homes that are joyous with love and song;
God, give us Christian homes;
God, give us Christian homes!

God, give us Christian homes!
Homes where the mother, in queenly quest,
Strives to show others Thy way is best,
Homes where the Lord is an honored guest;
God, give us Christian homes;
God, give us Christian homes!

4.
God, give us Christian homes!
Homes where the children are led to know
Christ in His beauty Who loves them so,
Homes where the altar fires burn and glow;
God, give us Christian homes;
God, give us Christian homes!
