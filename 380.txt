Belgrave - C.M.

1.
My God, accept my heart this day
and make it yours alone;
no longer let my footsteps stray
from your beloved Son.

2.
Before the cross of him who died
in awe and shame I fall:
let every sin be crucified
and Christ be all in all.

3.
Anoint me with your heavenly grace
and seal me as your own,
that I may see your glorious face
and worship at your throne.

4.
Let every thought and work and word
to you be ever given;
then life shall be your service, Lord,
and death the gate of heaven.

5.
All glory to the Father be,
the Spirit and the Son;
all love and praise eternally
to God the Three-in-One.

- M. Bridges
