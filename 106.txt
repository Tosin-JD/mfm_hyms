Awake, and Sing the Song - 6.6.8.6.

1.
Awake, and sing the song Of Moses and the Lamb;
Wake, ev’ry heart and ev'ry tongue,
To praise the Saviour's name.

2.
Sing of His dying love;
Sing of His rising pow’r;
Sing how He intercedes above For
those whose sins He bore.

3.
Sing on your heav’nly way, 
Ye ransomed sinners, sing;
Sing on, rejoicing ev’ry day In
Christ, the glorious King.

4.
Soon shall you hear Him say, “Ye
blessed children, come!’
Soon will He call you hence away,
And take His pilgrims home.
