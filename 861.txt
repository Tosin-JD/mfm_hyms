Jesus, The Saviour

1.
Who is there able the heart to make clean?
Jesus, Jesus!
Who is there able to free from all sin?
Jesus, the Saviour!

CHORUS
Ring out the anthem o’er land and o’er wave,
He is the only One able to save;
Power He hath over death and the grave
Jesus, the Saviour!

2.
Who is the Friend that is dearest of all?
Jesus, Jesus!
Who standeth ready to answer each call?
Jesus, the Saviour!

3.
Who hath prepared for His children a home?
Jesus, Jesus!
Who is it tenderly biddeth them come?
Jesus, the Saviour!-Edgar Lewis
