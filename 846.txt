There Is Joy In Serving Jesus - 8.7.8.7.

1.
There is joy in serving Jesus,
As I journey on my way,
Joy that fills the heart with praises,
Ev’ry hour and ev’ry day

CHORUS
There is joy, joy,
Joy in serving Jesus,
Joy that throbs the heart:
Ev’ry moment, ev’ry hour,
As I draw upon His pow’r,
Joy that never shall depart.

2.
There is joy in serving Jesus,
Joy that triumphs over pain;
Fills my soul with heaven's music,
Till I join the glad refrain.

3.
There is joy in serving Jesus,
As I walk alone with God;
'Tis the joy of Christ, my Saviour,
Who the path of suffering trod.

4.
There is joy in serving Jesus,
Joy amid the darkest night,
For I’ve learned the wondrous
secret,
And I’m walking in the light.

- Oswald J. Smith
