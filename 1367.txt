Boylston - S.M.
1 A charge to keep I have,
God to glorify,
A never dying soul to save, And fit it
for the sky. ,

2.
To serve the present age,
My calling to fulfill;
O may it all my pow'rs engage To
do my Masters will!

3.
Arm me with watchful care As in
Thy sight to live And
now thy servant, Lord, prepare
A strict account to give!

4.
Help me to watch and pray,
And still on Thee rely,
O let me hot my trust betray. But
press to realms on high.

- Charles Wesley
