Coming Home

1.
Like a wayward child I wandered
From my Father's house away,
But I hear His voice entreating,
And I’m coming home today,

CHORUS
Coming home, Coming home,
For I can no longer roam;
I am sad and broken hearted,
And I’m coming, coming home!

2.
I have wandered in the darkness,
And my path was lone and drear,
But my Father did not leave me,
He was watching ever near.

3.
O the rapture that awaits me
When I reach my Father’s door!
Once within its blest enclosure,
I am safe forever more.

4.
I will ask Him to forgive me
For the wrong that I have done,
To receive, accept, and bless me,
Thro' His well beloved Son.

- Fanny J. Crosby
