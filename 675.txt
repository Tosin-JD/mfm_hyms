Whittle -10.10.10.10. with Refrain

1.
Dying with Jesus, by death reckoned mine;
Living with Jesus a new life divine;
Looking to Jesus till glory doth shine,
Moment by moment, O Lord, I am Thine.

CHORUS
Moment by moment! I'm kept in His Hove;
Moment by moment I've life from above;
Looking to Jesus till glory doth shine;
Moment by moment, O Lord, I am Thine.

2.
Never a trial that He is not there,
Never a burden that He doth not bear,
Never a sorrow that He doth not share,
Moment by moment, Iâ€™m under His care.

3.
Never a weakness that He doth not feel,
Never a sickness that He cannot heal;
Moment by moment, in woe or in well,
Jesus my Saviour abides with me still.

- Daniel W. Whittle
