Never Thirst Again - C.M. and Refrain

1.
There is a land of pure delight
Where saints immortal reign,
Infinite day excludes the night.
And pleasures banish pain.CHORUS
We’re feeding on the living Bread,
We’re drinking at the fountain head:
And who so drinketh, Jesus said.
Shall never, never thrist again.
What! never thirst again?
No, never thirst again!
What! never thirst again?
No, never thirst again!
And whoso drinketh,
Jesus said, Shall never,
never thirst again!

2.
There everlasting spring abides,
And never withering flowers:
Death, like a narrow sea. divides
This heavenly land from ours.

3.
O could we make our doubts remove
Those gloomy thoughts that rise,
And see the Canaan that we love
With unbeclouded eyes.

4.
Could we but climb where Moses - stood
And view that landscape o'er.
Not Jordan’s stream, nor death’s cold flood.
Should fright us from the shore.

- Isaac Watts
