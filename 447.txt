447
He died of a broken heart

1.
Have you read the story of the Cross,
Where Jesus bled and died;
Where your debt was paid by His precious blood
That flowed from His wounded side?

CHORUS
He died of a broken heart for you,
He died of a broken heart;
Upon a tree, for you, for me,
He died of a broken heart.

2.
Have you read how they placed the crown of thorns
Upon His brow for you,
When He prayed, “Forgive them, oh, forgive;
They know not what they do?”

3.
Have you red how He saved the dying thief,
When hanging on the tree.
When He looked with pleading eyes and said,
“Dear Lord, remember Me?"

4.
O Have you read that He looked to heaven and said,
“Tis finished?" 'Twas for thee!
Have you ever said, “I thank
Thee, Lord,For giving Thy life for me?”
