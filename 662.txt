Yesterday, Today, Forever

1.
O, how sweet the glorious mes sage,
Simple faith may claim;
Yesterday, today, forever,
Jesus is the same.
Still He loves to save the sinful,
Heal the sick and lame;
Cheer the mourner, still the tempest.
Glory to His name!

CHORUS
Yesterday, today, forever, Jesus is the same.
All may change, but Jesus never!
Glory to His name,
Glory to His name, Glory to His name,
All may change, but Jesus never!
Glory to His name.

2.
He who was the Friend of Sinners,
Seeks thee, lost one, now;
Sinner, come, and at
His footstool, Penitently bow.
He who said, I'll not condemn thee,
Go, and sin no more,’’
Speaks to thee that word of pardon.
As in days of yore.

3.
Him who pardoned erring Peter,
Never need’s thou fear;
He that came to faithless Thomas,
All thy doubt will clear.
He who let the loved disciple
On His bosom rest,
Bids thee still, with love as tender,
Lean upon His breast.

4.
He who ‘mid the raging billows,
Walk'd upon the sea;
Still can hush our wildest tempest,
As on Galilee.
He who wept and prayedIn anguish In Gethsemane,
Drinks with us each cup of trembling,
In our agony.

5.
As of old He walk’d to Emmaus,
With them to abide;
So thro’ all life’s way He walketh,
Ever near our side.
Soon again shall we behold Him,
Hasten, Lord, the day!
But twill still be This same Jesus,”
As He went away.
